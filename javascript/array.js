		chapter: `<p> Sitting on the side of the road, Samael doesn't know why he is in this world. Samael Duodere, is the only son of the Duodere family who is an ordinary family in the city of Wahingtong D.C! </p>

		<p> This is a world that is parallel to the earth in Samael's memory, but somehow this world is called Blue Star! even the land is a little bigger than the memory that is on the head of Samael! </p>
		
		<p> Memory? is he reincarnated? maybe!? Why aren't you sure? because his past memories are blurred! </p>
		
		<p> Although the history of this world is not that different from his previous life! </p>
		
		<p> But many characters and cultures are missing! </p>
		
		<p> "But this is a bit problematic ... what is this book? The Request Book? Why do I feel like you've always instigated me to open it for these 4 years?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael looks at the book in front of him while sitting in his classroom chair. </p>
		
		<p> Even though he is not a genius, Samael is still considered smart because he was able to enter Georgetown University which is arguably famous here! </p>
		
		<p> He's currently majoring in business here! </p>
		
		<p> "Ahh - !!! Just open it! even though I feel that my life will change if I open it!" </p>
		
		<p> A bright beam of light charged straight at Samael's body and his vision blurred instantly! </p>
		
		<p> "Yes, young man ... do you not like it here?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael turned his head to see a handsome figure with white hair flowing down his shoulders and back straight. Sharp eyebrows and perfect lips as if he were a character out of the world! </p>
		
		<p> Samael stroked his temple and said, "Don't say that you are a god who will change my future?" </p>
		
		<p> "Yes and No!" answer that person. </p>
		
		<p> Samael sighed and immediately sat down in this pure white world, "The Book of Requests, is it yours?" </p>
		
		<p> The man also sat down and said, "Yes! it's mine. The reason is in your hands, obviously ... I threw it away. I needed entertainment, and it happened that the book fell on your head. No, you're lucky ..." </ p>
		
		<p> Samael sighed again, "First past life memories and reincarnation, then god things like you. You know, I'm quite satisfied with my current life ..." </p>
		
		<p> "I know, but ... you as a human must have ambition, right?" </p>
		
		<p> "I can't deny it ..." Samael propped his hands back and continued looking up, "The Blue Star world, although its history, knowledge, and famous people are mostly the same ... there is something different from the Earth World, Polygamy. . "</p>
		
		<p> The man laughed outright, "Hahaha-! Do you want to become the Emperor with 72 Concubines ?!" </p>
		
		<p> "Hahaha, don't forget ... I'm still young. So God, you won't regret choosing me right? Don't say you'll get bored halfway and pull everything I got later ?!" </p>
		
		<p> "Tsk! You think I, this great and handsome God will do that? If I get tired of you, I just have to find other humans in thousands of other worlds and make them my entertainment!" </p>
		
		<p> "Ahh, you're mean. But I can't blame you." Samael then looked seriously at the person, "So, what is the function of this book?" </p>
		
		<p> The man shrugged his shoulders, "I thought you already knew ... yes, it's called the Request Book, obviously all requests will be granted by him! Unfortunately there is only one request every one year! Isn't that fair?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed bitterly, "For us humans, even if ten years of one wish, we will be greedy fighting over this book. Don't say anymore, the world might be destroyed!" </p>
		
		<p> The person was stunned and patted his thigh and laughed loudly, "I like you brat! well, write your wish first. It's not that I'm good or anything, you've been keeping this book for 4 years. Really, I don't know why you didn't open it for that? "</p>
		
		<p> "I told you, I'm satisfied with this life. But ... you should already know my current state as a god." </p>
		
		<p> "Ahh, I'm so sorry for your father who passed away the day before. You were the only male in the family, one mother and three younger sisters ... I wouldn't say you were noble because of strong affection for your family, but that's human nature. "</p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed bitterly and shrugged helplessly, Samael's father Luric Duodere unfortunately passed away at the age of 47 leaving Samael, his mother, and 3 sisters at the age of 21 years old Samael! </p>
		
		<p> Samael's mother is Helina Viollen, 37 years old! </p>
		
		<p> Still young and virtuous, beautiful, seductive, and very caring for her family! </p>
		
		<p> It could be said that Samael's father was fierce towards his mother, just imagine, Samael is 21 years old, doesn't that mean Samael's mother gave birth at 16 ?! Oh my God! why isn't he jailed! </p>
		
		<p> Samael's first daughter and younger sister named Tilina Duodere, aged 19 years old and just taking his college education! </p>

		<p> But don't underestimate it! she still works side by side as a model! She is very beautiful after all. </p>
		
		<p> The second daughter is Ririca Duodere, 16 years old. Still in high school and loves hanging out with his friends! But he's made money too! by becoming a little Streamer! </p>
		
		<p> Then the third daughter, Finri Duodere, is still 5 years old and is the darling of the family! </p>
		
		<p> Samael touched the Request Book beside him and immediately opened it, only pure white paper was printed there, even though the book is about 800 pages thick! </p>
		
		<p> "Yes, there you are. Write, write your wish and let you cheer me on!" </p>
		
		<p> "Shut up, I'm concentrating!" </p>
		
		<p> << 1. Luck is unlimited !!! </p>
		
		<p> 2. Applications like in the novel World of Entertainment Star Circle that make close friendships with stars in the world! >> </p>
		
		<p> "Oh? World of Entertainment Star Circle, nice step to get rich. With strong friendships with other rich or influential people, you can keep the green light in your business. But only the boundaries in the world of Blue Star and Earth are friends who you can. Although there are some surprises for you later. "</p>
		
		<p> "Plus unlimited luck, if you go to a casino in Las Vegas, you get rich right away! Although I don't know why you didn't write down your third and fourth wishes." </p>
		
		<p> Samael chuckled, "Yes, this is the best move I can think of. The world of Blue Star is not too dangerous, so let me cheat like this ... for my family. For the third and fourth wishes, let me think about it later, make it. in case. "</p>
		
		<p> "Yeah, don't be too stiff. Now, in addition, let me help you save this book." </p>
		
		<p> The Book of Requests suddenly turned into a stream of light and shot straight through the back of Samael's right hand. There you immediately saw a black tattoo with the open book logo on it. </p>
		
		<p> "Then I'll send you back. Remember, cheer me up, well ... I'm also curious about your luck. Maybe when you come back a girl will come to you? Hehehe ...." </p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed too and his gaze turned blurry again. When his vision cleared, he saw that he was currently in the same seat, the difference was ... he was asleep! </p>
		
		<p> "Are you awake? Samael?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael looked sideways timidly and finally sighed, "Liu Yue, don't scare me. Right now it should be Mr. Polus's time teaching, he is very fierce! ... it's Mr. Polus' time right?" </ p>
		
		<p> The woman named Liu Yue covered her mouth and laughed gracefully, "If afraid, why are you sleeping right now? But you are very lucky! Mr. Police just arrived 4 minutes ago, Samael, you are safe!" </p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed awkwardly and he looked at Liu Yue's face. She is a foreign student from China and Samael has known her for 3 months ago. Even though Hot lost to the female figure in America, Lui Yue was still beautiful, her face and lips were rather thin, and her slender eyebrows flew towards her temples, revealing a pair of slender and sharp eyes. </p>
		
		<p> Liu Yue was a little embarrassed to see Samael staring at her face, but she still smiled and muttered: "is it satisfied?" </p>
		
		<p> "No way, if satisfied, can I kiss you?"</p>

		<p>Hello, this is my second original novel. I have written up to 5 novels three of which were dropped</p>
		
		<p>To be fair two of them were the same novel that had a slight difference. The first novel I wrote had way too many problems to count.</p>
		
		<p>The girl on the cover was not done by me nor do I own it either. I found it through google images and edited. If you are the owner please tell me if you'd like it taken down or be credited. The cover will change over time as I either learn digital art or pay some talented artist.</p>`,
		chapter: `<p>In a quaint little home situated in the busy city of New York was an average-looking young man who was quarrelling with an equally young woman.<br> <br> &quot;Don't call me unless it's for Rose and don't try to ruin my career&quot; Shouted the young blond woman<br> <br> &quot;Don't worry, I have no plans to get involved in your life. From this day forward you are no longer my wife, nor are you my child's mother&quot; Said the young brunette man with his fist clenched and his body shaking with pure anger<br> <br> &quot;I'm still Rose's mother&quot; Shouted the woman<br> <br> &quot;You're no mother!! A mother would care and love for their child. Sacrificing a limb if necessary but YOU, you picked the dirty corrupted entertainment industry. Leave now&quot; Said the young man<br> <br> (Note: Plz don't be offended I'm not saying women should be at home. I respect women, read a few lines further down and you'll understand)<br> <br> The Young Lady walked out of the house and left. Leaving only a shadow of memories that left the young man confused.<br> <br> *Sigh* 'How did it come to this. It's for the best. Hopefully, I would never have to see or hear from that bitch again' Thought the young man as he pulls out a small rectangular box from his chest pocket.<br> <br> Opening the small box he pulls out a white cylinder item that was placed between his lips.<br> <br> The item between his lips is a sweet that appears to look like chalk or could be mistaken as a cigarette from a distant.<br> <br> This was something quite the norm for him as this was his method of giving up his smoking habits.<br> <br> He had given up a lot for his family including Alcohol and work. He had given up work to be the rare stay at home dad.<br> <br> The women who just left was the breadwinner of the family, her name was Bethany Hunt now Bethany Jones, after the divorce, it changed back to her family name.<br> <br> The young man who was left to pick up the pieces of his life and his daughter's life is Theodore Hunt.<br> <br> 23 years old unemployed father with average scores and standard C.V. A typical dad bod with a very ordinary face and black crew cut hairstyle not counting his grey eyes.<br> <br> Though he appears ordinary in actuality, he is far from it, he has secret that he has kept since two years ago.<br> <br> Two years ago on the night of his daughters birth, Theodore Hunt died.<br> <br> The cause of death was embarrassingly due to tripping over his untied shoelace and hitting his head at the hospital's receptions desk.<br> <br> That night another man from a similar world took over the dead body of Theodore Hunt.<br> <br> David Johnson was the man that took control over the body. He's a simple white-collar worker that spent most of his free time on the internet or planning a way to make money quick. He abruptly died from an elevator malfunction.<br> <br> There was nothing at all special about him yet by some heavenly luck, he had the luxury to live once again.<br> <br> He was excited at first but he later discovers that he had nothing to bring to this new life of his. Apart from some odd quirks and some new shows to watch it was just another life to live.<br> <br> Although the world shares some similar things like the geography of the world and some historical events they have some very huge changes like the entertainment industry is not at all the same nor is the technology.<br> <br> The entertainment industry isn't bad but a feeling of emptiness is felt from anything he watches, listens to and plays.<br> <br> Technology in this world is leaps ahead with most things running on green energy.<br> <br> Even computers and Mobile phone are mostly made-up of a holographic image and have an incredible picture quality.<br> <br> Their step-in VR technology had already reached the level of being able to place the subconscious in a virtual world.<br> <br> After a lot of backlashes, the technology was banned for the high chance of death and now VR is done with the physical body.<br> <br> And the biggest difference is the presence of powers being considered the norm. It is recorded that powers have existed since the stone age.<br> <br> That does indeed mean powers were present in the world war and it also means that each country had its own historic &quot;Captain America&quot; legend.<br> <br> Even with the presence of superpowers, there is a small number of people that dress up and keep the streets safe.<br> <br> Although this world has superpowers it's normally just a meaningless power. 99.9% of the population will get a power that amounts to the same usefulness as the power Warm Hands.<br> <br> Which as the name entails is the ability to make your hands warm. Powers that have similar usefulness are called Minor-Powers<br> <br> The 0.1% would be the ones that hold powers that are considered a danger to society like telekinesis, super strength, super speed and so on.<br> <br> These types of powers are rightfully titled as Super-powers. Even with the title to differentiate none lethal and potentially lethal power holders only a few certain powers will cause many to be fearful and even be put on a watch list.<br> <br> Theodore Hunt is one of these Super-Power holders with the ability to create 3 identical clones of himself.<br> <br> His cloning ability makes him able to share senses with every clone. If a clone dies they disappear in the form of light particles.<br> <br> Clones do not have human personality but run on a set of instructions that are made by the original body. These instruction are very clear and simple like running, jumping and other simple stuff.<br> <br> This is due to the fact that his brain is unable to conjure up a false personality and is too weak to control three bodies at once.<br> <br> When you find out that you are under the Super-Power criteria you are then to attend a boot camp at 18 where you are taught to mix back into society but in truth, it is a year of military service.<br> <br> The military was keen to have a clone user, so they put him under surveillance before confirming that his personality had no faults.<br> <br> With that confirmation, multiple high ups around the base poured in trying to pull in the new asset into thier regiments.<br> <br> His ability we're immediately seen as making him the best scout and off the grid telecommunications.<br> <br> Theodore learnt everything from Gun Handling, Wilderness Survival, Boxing and Emergency First Aid and so on.<br> <br> He was the perfect soldier with talent like no other. So when it came to the end of one year of military service Theodore was to decide whether to stay or rejoin society.<br> <br> He decided to leave as he had his girlfriend waiting for him. Yes, the girl he left his promising career as a soldier was Bethany the very same women that just walked out on him.<br> <br> He doesn't regret it because what came out of the relationship was his beloved two-year-old daughter Rose Hunt.<br> <br> A short chubby baby girl that can already walk and say a few words.<br> <br> This was quite normal even in his past life but he couldn't help thinking that she was a natural-born genius.<br> <br> Before having the Baby, Bethany was working as a signed artist for a big entertainment company called Heat Entertainment.<br> <br> She at the time had a very a timid figure, average talent and didn't have any real appeal.<br> <br> After giving birth Bethany's body changed with her hips widening and her breast growing to a prominent D cup.<br> <br> After losing the weight she was a curvy goddess that had a mature air surrounding her.<br> <br> Her company immediately took up the opportunity and gave her a small roll in a comedy show in return she had to give up her identity as a mother and married woman.<br> <br> Theodore began to see that his wife was no longer helping in the money situation. All of it was going into her look to be a superstar. Theodore was forced to sell some of his family heirlooms.<br> <br> As time passed she was no longer coming home and just sending the bare minimum through a banking app.<br> <br> &quot;To think she gave us up so easily&quot; Said Theodore sadly<br> <br> He walked towards a bookshelf that was in the living room and pulled out two small cases. Inside were two platinum rings that had a diamond on top.<br> <br> &quot;I spent a fortune on you guys but in the end it meant nothing. Sigh, I need to sell these hopefully the money I get out of it will last a month or two. Now I have to figure out a way to make money from home. This would be easier if I had any memory of my past world. Why do I remember every detail yet whenever it came to any form of entertainment it's just a blur&quot; Said Theodore<br> <br> Walking up a set of stairs quietly he snuck up to a door that had stickers all over it. Slowly turning the knob he peeked into the darkroom.<br> <br> Slowly pushing the door open walked over to the drawn curtains and opened it to allow the morning light in.<br> <br> The light immediately attacked the little sleeping beauty that responded by pulling the blanket over her head.<br> <br> Theodore walked to the baby cot and said &quot;Rise and shine, Rose&quot;<br> <br> The figure bundled up in a blanket began to twist in discomfort.<br> <br> A muffled voice sounded from the blanket &quot;~hmmm NO!, Night Night!!~&quot;<br> <br> Theodore grinned and reached in and tugged the blanket down showing his tired daughter &quot;Come on, wake up&quot;<br> <br> Red blush on her chubby cheeks with her pearl white completion and her blond hair in disarray. Strawberry Blonde like her mother with unique grey eyes that came from Theodore.<br> <br> Adding to all of this was her grumpy little mouth that stuck out showing an angry pout.<br> <br> Rose responded with a cute little nose scrunch and a disapproving head shake. With her eyes squinting she replied &quot;I want Night Night&quot;<br> <br> &quot;That's too bad because It looks like a great day to play in the park but if you want night, night I guess we can't,&quot; Said Theodore exaggeratedly<br> <br> Her eyes opened up in anticipation as she kicked her blanket off and stood up quickly with her hands in the air, she spoke &quot;Up&quot;<br> <br> &quot;Haha,&quot; Theodore chuckled and scooped her up with his hands under her armpits.<br> <br> &quot;Phew, getting heavier by the day you are&quot; Said Theodore as his tickled her oversized tummy<br> <br> &quot;Hehehe, no Heehehe daddy stop it,&quot; Said Rose while wiggling in his arms<br> <br> &quot;Sniff, sniff, good job, no mess today,&quot; Said Theodore as he did his routine check on her nappy/diaper<br> <br> &quot;Yep no mess&quot; Said Rose with a happy smile<br> <br> Carrying her to the bathroom he helped her brush her baby teeth and washed her face. They then sat down on the table to have breakfast.<br> <br> Theodore was having a bowl of cereal and a glass orange juice. Rose was oatmeal that had honey and dried fruits with her sippy cup.<br> <br> &quot;Finish&quot; Said Rose as she pushed the bowl forward and wiped her mouth with her bib.<br> <br> &quot;Did it taste good&quot; Asked Theodore<br> <br> &quot;Really, tasty~,&quot; Said Rose happily while nodding rapidly<br> <br> &quot;That's good&quot; Said Theodore while patting her head<br> <br> &quot;Hehe watch, please&quot; Rose pleaded<br> <br> &quot;Okay remember don't sit so close to the T.V,&quot; Said Theodore as he got her off the high chair.<br> <br> Then went to the living room with Rose following closely behind. Rose sat down on the couch as Theodore put her cartoons on.<br> <br> &quot;Stay far away from the T.V okay&quot; Said, Theodore<br> <br> Rose looked back and said while nodding &quot;Far away&quot;<br> <br> Theodore sat next to her and pulled out a metal rod the size of a pen. Pulling the side a blue holographic image sprung up from the space in between.<br> <br> He found a few answers like the so-called online shop, a writer, artist and an online influencer.<br> <br> Online shopping needs investment and money, he has none of those things. A writer needs the creative ability to create a story worth reading, no use his imagination has been<br> <br> This leaves online influencer it's has a lot more freedom and could be easily done from home.<br> <br> Doing some basic research he found a popular streaming platform that went by the name of WideView. Then he found that they generously allow for newcomers to keep 100&#8453; of the donation they gain for the first two weeks.<br> <br> After that streamers would be only getting 40% until they manage to get partnered where it would then change to 50%.<br> <br> He quickly went through the sign up before coming to halt as he was asked to make a name.<br> <br> 'Hmmm, what should I go with. It has to be memorable, and unique yet still be easy to spell. . . name? name?. . . ' he thought long and hard before he noticed that his name was being filled in one letter after another.<br> <br> S_I_N_G_L_E_ _D_A_D<br> <br> (Note: The name is up for suggestions. I want it to related to dad)<br> <br> &quot;Wait, no what the F *Cough*,&quot; Said Theodore in a startled tone before looking towards Rose.<br> <br> Thankfully he stopped himself.<br> <br> &quot;But how? Is this a joke? Am I getting pranked by a hacker&quot; Said Theodore loudly<br> <br> &quot;Shush! me watching&quot; Said Rose with a grumpy pout and a finger over her lip<br> <br> &quot;Sorry, princess,&quot; Said Theodore apologetically<br> <br> &quot;It's okay&quot; Said Rose with a pure smile before looking back at the T.V<br> <br> 'Calm down, I can just go back' Thought Theodore<br> <br> &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; PROFILE CREATED &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull;<br> <br> &quot;NO!&quot; Said Theodore while spamming the back button to no avail<br> <br> 'Holly Fuck, everyone's gonna think I'm a creep. My name is literally an introduction to a dating site. . . . It's not too bad I mean it's definitely unique and memorable. . . who am I kidding this is bad' Thought, Theodore<br> <br> While in his moment of confusion and anger with himself and to whoever had messed with him a deafening noise sounded.<br> <br> *DING*<br> <br> At the sound of the noise, he instinctively blinked in shock. When he opened his eyes again he saw something floating in the corner of his vision.<br> <br> &quot;Huh??!!!&quot; Said Theodore in a confused and startled tone</p>`,

		<p>A Spartan who seemed to be no more than 25 years old spoke to me, the guy was wearing a cuirass made of several layers of hardened and glued linen, reinforced with bronze plates that were quite resistant to blows. In the area of ​​the lower abdomen he had strips of the same material superimposed, to facilitate movement. He also wore a bronze Corinthian style helmet with a black crest and in his left hand he carried a wooden shield, concave and round covered with a thin layer of bronze to adorn it and to strengthen it, on the legs they wore bronze greaves that covered the leg. below the knee and in his right hand he had a 3 meter long spear with an iron tip and a counterweight, finally a 50 cm long Spartan sword that was used in emergencies. And a red cape on his back.</p>
		
		<p>I remember his name and it was Ezio, a Spartan noted for his intelligence and perseverance. Next to him were 4 more guys dressed in the same way, I was also dressed like that, only I had a red crest instead of the black one. . The tallest was Gregory who was cautious and vigilant, the most muscular was Leo a strong, brave and wild man, the slimmest and smallest who is actually short when compared to the others measuring 1.78 meters called Keelan and finally Tassos who had a scar on his eye he was very thoughtful and rational.</p>
		
		<p>Even if I want to leave, we are surrounded! I thought in my mind and I could only sigh for my bad luck, reborn into a prince I am supposed to relax since I would not have any problem, but now I am surrounded by hundreds of elite soldiers who want to my head.</p>
		
		<p>So knowing that he would die anyway I will try to make it as epic as possible so that my name is remembered in the history books.</p>
		
		<p>I threw myself towards the Persian immortals and as if my body knew what to do with my spear I pierced one, lifted his body and threw it towards the other immortals. The immortals began to counterattack, but they were very weak, I waved my spear making a horizontal cut opening the belly of five immortals who fell to the ground screaming in pain, my spear got caught in one of their bodies I tried to pull it out, but I felt that for me back a spear wanted to pierce me. I tried to raise my shield but an immortal was grabbing it, but before that spear reached me, the immortal collapsed to the ground with a spear that pierced his skull, It was Gregory who was a few meters from me, I wanted to thank him but it was not the moment, I left my spear on the ground and drew my sword and pierced through the mouth of the immortal who was following agpulling down my shield. I pulled the body away from him and continued advancing towards the immortals waving my sword cutting limbs, decapitating. My body seemed to have limitless energy.</p>
		
		<p>Meanwhile Gregory, who threw the spear to defend Maximus, cut with his sword, only beheading cleanly because he preferred to ensure the death of the enemy, he was the most elegant in battle, on the other hand, Leo with his spear pierced 4 immortals and threw them up. , with his shield he blocked the spears that came towards him. Tassos and Keelan also began to stab with their spears, and Ezio who was the smartest while killing immortals was looking for a way out for the prince, King Leonidas made him swear on his honor that he would take Maximus to Sparta.</p>
		
		<p>Everyone knows that for a Spartan death is not something he fears, what if it terrifies them is dying without honor. They long for the blood of their enemies, but they will always follow the orders of their King, which is why they were feared throughout Greece for their ferocity and obedience.</p>
		
		<p>An hour passed, but the immortals kept coming, but we were like lions surrounded by small dogs, although they were quite a few alone, they made us small wounds, I don't know how many times I waved my sword, but I already felt tired.</p>
		
		<p>Prince, the Persians are retreating</p>
		
		<p>Ezio pointed me forward, it was true the Persians were retreating but guys with mystical masks came, I think they are the Persian magicians. He was not afraid of them because according to the story they were only people who knew something about gunpowder.</p>
		
		<p>But I couldn't react to what they did, they took out a piece of paper and put it on the ground and everything under us started to glow and some kind of mysterious rune appeared.</p>
		
		<p>-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -----</p>
		
		<p>Inform King Xerxes that the Spartan Prince Maximus was killed with the holy relic, but after its use it became useless.</p>
		
		<p>The messenger rushed out on his horse</p>
		
		<p>And to think that we had to use it, but it was necessary, we didn't have more time, King Xerxes was too angry, and he wanted revenge for the wound that the Spartan King made him.</p>
		
		<p>After this the Persians withdrew, leaving a field of corpses and in the middle of these an area with rare symbols that still glowed but slowly disappeared.</p>
		
		<p>-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ----------</p>
		
		<p>I feel dizzy and with a fairly strong headache, I opened my eyes with pain and saw the others getting up from the floor with difficulty.</p>
		
		<p>Prince, are you okay?</p>
		
		<p>Tassos seems to have been the first to recover.</p>
		
		<p>Well let's hope the others wake up more see what we do</p>
		
		<p>After ten minutes everyone was awake. We all quickly began to discuss where we are and finally we understood that we were in an unknown place.</p>
		
		<p>While we were planning what to do we heard a sound of a fight a few meters from where we were, it seemed to be the roar of a beast and some screams of some women.</p>
		
		<p>Prince, we get closer to see?</p>
		
		<p>In my mind I was still worried that we are on a desert island, imagine being adrift with five muscular guys, just thinking about it made my hair stand on end. But the sound of the fight gave me a slight hope so I accepted Ezio's suggestion.</p>
		
		<p>So we get ready, adjust our armor, and check that our weapons are in good shape. Leo had to leave his spear because it was already deformed, it seems that this guy needs a weapon that is resistant to demonstrate his full potential.</p>
		
		<p>We adjust our breathing and move in an orderly fashion toward the sound. I took the lead directing the formation.</p>
		
		<p>-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ----</p>
		
		<p>In the trees was a beautiful woman who had pointed ears, golden hair to the waist, marking those dazzling and fascinating curves, on top of her she wore a golden diadem and strangely she was also protected by a silver armor. The face of this woman was very beautiful without any imperfection, her lips were red and soft, her slightly golden eyes gave off the youth of spring. Her bust was plump that would attract the eye of any man and cause several bleeds.</p>
		
		<p>Her beautiful crescent-shaped brows were furrowed which showed that she was quite concerned. She wielded a long bow and shot arrows at the monsters below, in the trees of her near her there was also</p>`,

		originalDesc: '<p>A modern man reborn into World of Cultivation, reaching the top in his own unique way... (Alternative World, replacing original MC, Original powers, Grey MC, self-made Mc)</p>',
		chapter: `<p>(Most of the chapter is MC early life and it's mostly Summary)</p>

		<p>Surely reborn is a great thing, is it? Having that thought that this time it will be different! That you will do certain things differently! Like you wouldn't be shy as much as before! Or you will finally say those words to your dream girl!</p>
		
		<p>Yet for me, it was a different kind of second chance...</p>
		
		<p>First of all, I was not on Earth any more...</p>
		
		<p>How do I know? Well, the moon is too big, and the sky itself has multi-coloured Stars! , yes multi-coloured! and another thing is that people here are all Chinese looking, and building style is that of Ancient China, so when you put those things together and put that extra unique energy everyone is talking about...</p>
		
		<p>You will find out that...</p>
		
		<p>That I am in Cultivation world... should I be excited? Probably? After all, this world has badass Kung Fu moves, probably incredible beautiful women, Icy Queens, and some scheming ones as well... with a bunch of Young 'Always Boner' young master's running around...</p>
		
		<p>So, yes I am excited and terrified...</p>
		
		<p>Excited because there is a chance I can become something more, and terrified that I am born into a Farming household, where my parents know jack shit about cultivation, basics among basic, at least they showed me how to enter into the 'profound way'.</p>
		
		<p>A Very simple procedure, basically people born into this world have something called 'Profound veins', an extra set of veins which exist inside one's body, what I have to do is pull my 'Vital Energy' into these veins, once such thing is done, I will enter into the first Stage of Elementary Profound...</p>
		
		<p>This realm has 10 stages, and once I am stage 10 elementary profound I will be able to break through to Nascent Profound which is considered the first step towards 'Profound way'...</p>
		
		<p>A very cliché if I say so, but unlike my parents and brothers and sister of this world I did something else, alongside simply just sitting in Lotus position and pulling my vital energy into my Profound Veins...</p>
		
		<p>As they mentioned, what is 'Vital Energy'? Well In layman terms its Stamina in 'physical form' or 'Liquid form' I am not a scientist or medic, but that's the only thing I can think off, such thing never existed in my world, But I know one thing to improve one's stamina, and that is Physical training, there is no gym here, but as ex-employee of Gym and SPA, and having friends with P.T and therapists I learned few things how to train and upkeep one's body...</p>
		
		<p>So at the tender age of 8, I started training... and it was time when I learned that I was blessed, like any other Main character of Wuxia or is this world Xianxia? Gods who cares... I got cheats! In terms of very 'crude' system or power depends on view really...</p>
		
		<p>What it does is very simple yet considerate OP as well thing, what I need to do for it to work, is a herb or wood, or metal, then I can access its structure learn its secrets, abilities, or powers, and then I can pull it out, and add it into a thing of my choice, a very broken and powerful ability... what I do not know yet is, is it only for items or can I do it with cultivation related things like techniques ?, since I am reborn into one such world...</p>
		
		<p>But, Of course, I didn't have a chance to test much with it apart of working in Herb field where I was creating a Vitality herb, that's right! I haven't yet broken through to Elementary Profound as I was building up my vitality with exercises, something similar to special diet as well, Funny enough in this world concept of Physical exercise is unheard off...</p>
		
		<p>And so by the time I was 10, I started cultivating, with no modern-day activities or entertainment it was quite easy to fall into such routine, I even started to enjoy meditation and exercises, the concept of this Profound energy intrigued me, is it similar to KI from Dragon Ball? Or is it leaning towards magic?</p>
		
		<p>And so less then Two months Later I had a breakthrough, the feeling was incredible, someone like me from modern who never imagined such power instead relied on technology to do things, was an eye-opener, I can understand how this much power can easily get into one's head, especially into spoiled teenagers heads!</p>
		
		<p>After this breakthrough, I continued to cultivate, and train my body, with my system which I can considerate a mix of gaming like alchemy and crafting I was able to understand more about my Profound Veins, as for next levels of cultivation I will need to absorb Profound energy from Air into my Veins, the thing I found that there are around 54 entrances...</p>
		
		<p>How I found this? Well it's not too hard Since I spend a lot of time meditating and trying to understand Profound energy, one can stumble upon where the entrance is to one body, from there one I worked to understand this concept, how do I open them?, more importantly, how do I control it?</p>
		
		<p>So I started with Herbs I knew around my village, many of them have simple ones, and in the way a short reaction to one Profound energy, from paralysis to accelerating one's healing process, very basic and according to villages healer very common herbs</p>
		
		<p>No people of cultivators would care about such cheap stuff... but for me who can extract that effect and continuously combine to point where it can evolve into greater effect is a gold mine</p>
		
		<p>What I did is simple I made a few very basic pills with each herb, from healing to poison, and everything between, and then I started my hunt for herbs...</p>
		
		<p>By the time of my 12 birthday I finally did it!, no only I achieved Nascent Profound but, I unlocked all of my 54 entrances! The speed of Profound Energy channelling increased several-fold, and my speed of cultivation was increased to the stupendous amount, I knew what I did was incredible, and I will get a lot of attention, so next thing I focused on was creating A profound Art to manipulate Profound Entrances and conceal cultivation if needed</p>
		
		<p>And thanks God's or is it Heavens now? That I did!, as only a few months later did our Village had a visitors from local overlords the Sky Sword Sect, as the name indicates these 'Cultivators' are sword users and they use mostly Sword arts, the man leading this 'inspection' was a man in Spirit Profound Realm, and his minions were in True Profound, a realm after the one I am...</p>
		
		<p>After their arrival villagers started the usual ass-kissing, which led to my exposure, the villagers were far too happy to give me to this Sect for extra resources from them, it was the day I experience this worlds ugliness for the first time, they didn't ask me, neither they cared what I think, and my 'parents'? Well, they even added my sister to mix, fewer mouths to feed...</p>
		
		<p>They didn't even care how dodgy this Sect's reputation is, even we here in this God's forgotten village, know how they treat people who are not of the ruling family...</p>
		
		<p>For someone who was born into a free world, and someone who always had independence from the moment I finished high school, It rubbed me the wrong way...</p>
		
		<p>I already started plotting these people demise, this Sect, and this double-faced Village, They will know not to mess with my independence...</p>
		
		<p>The journey, to this Sect, was short, the compound was just like I expected was a city on its own with hundreds of pavilions, and Hundred thousands if not millions of people living in this place, it's like nothing I have seen before, yes I did live in one of biggest cities in the world before rebirth, but this? It's only a Sect which is considerate average at best... with their Elders being in Earth Profound, and their Master an Early Sky Profound Expert, which basically a realm where one can fly... with their own power, which is incredible motivation actually to reach for me.</p>
		
		<p>Once I arrived there, I was taken to 'proper' Earth Profound expert who inspected me, he was very impressed and instantly took me under his wing, the man instantly said that I have potential to be Elder, as the sect is actually family-based, so I will need to marry into the family and get name Jian added to my one, by the way, my name in this world is simply Feng, that's right simply Feng... to have a surname or house name people have to be quite rich in the first place...</p>
		
		<p>Not that I am planning to stay in this place for long, my master already had that weird Idea that I am already loyal to this Sect... that is the most humorous thing I have ever heard...he took me from my home, and force me to work for them, even look down, on me genius or not... since I am outsider, they even consider me like some livestock...</p>
		
		<p>For next two years, I abused the resources my master gave me, I even learned that he bragged to rest of Elders how he got a 'gem' from some peasant farm for his daughter, and how my sister is nothing like me, and how she is totally useless who will only reach True Profound in her whole life...</p>
		
		<p>That obviously rubbed me the wrong way, with all that nonsense going on she vanished from my life.</p>
		
		<p>The worst part, she WAS already a nothing more than a servant to one of the elders young Master, which is considerate high honour, that comment alone, have put a death marks on this filth, as this master is notorious how he treats his servants...</p>
		
		<p>It didn't take long for me to put things together, and learn her fate, that's why I hate this sect and what hold the main family has... even if I am genius I can't do jack sh1t!</p>
		
		<p>So instead I focused on my main objective, at age 14 my cultivation has reached fifth of True Profound, why so low you ask? Why the reason is easy, I am not showing off to these filths, instead and I am studying, gathering resources, creating a completely new branch of Profound Arts, which is included a proper cultivation method! Why? Because these morons don't have one! According to the Elder responsible for Profound Arts Library is that no one has such a thing! Because all you need is to absorb energy from the air, that was the man's explanation! which was utterly absurd, that's why I spend a lot of time thanks to my 'system' creating a new cultivation method.</p>
		
		<p>And that's right! I figured out my 'system' main point which word similarly like that Novel heavenly library something... only much more bastard version of it, taking bits, and pieces from art and putting together and creating a perfect one from all bits and pieces, something like some sort pillaging and reusing system...</p>
		
		<p>After all the preparation, I was finally ready for my grand plan, what I am about to do would probably earn a good amount of shoulder patting from someone like Darth Sidious, as I about to poison whole Sects top brass, and then to Perform a Profound Formation deployment in inner sect Grounds, which I was setting up for past months, and half, these bastards are so high on their Profound energy that they don't even realise that it's so easy to seal it or even take it away...</p>
		
		<p>People in this world are very, I mean very narrow-minded, everything in this society operates on Profound energy and its given power, and I will exploit that...</p>
		
		<p>Then Night came, I sprinkled the poison I prepared on Food, and drinks, people will consume, because of my status as one of the elders direct students, I was allowed to enter here, the Servant thought I personally overmatching this events food preparations...</p>
		
		<p>The funny thing with this poison is that it has nothing to do with Profound Energy, something which probably never existed in this world before, this poison targets motor control, and neurons in people bodies, turning them into prisoners in their own bodies, once that is done the formation will activate, and they will die...and their profound energies will converge in one point where I will create a very powerful pill for my cultivation...</p>
		
		<p>Then the time came I observed the proud and arrogant bunch of men older in their hundred years bragging about their students, talking shit about their rival sect, until...</p>
		
		<p>One by one they all dropped like flies, it didn't matter if it was Earth Profound or Sky Profound, in end they were still Humans, and humans still have to rely on their brains, the best thing is that I have figured out is, that which part of the brain is responsible for controlling one's Profound energy, and the answer was quite easy, its the part of the brain were senses are understood and commanded from, All I have to do is prepare Poison which concentrates on that part of the body, once it's done I focused making it invisible to Profound energy in one's body, after all its not attacking the energy it's attacking its neurons and motor control...</p>
		
		<p>I could stop myself from not laughing after seeing people which I genuine have harboured hatred at fall like flies...</p>
		
		<p>"HAHAHAHA" I walked over to place where my master was lying down, I kicked him into the side, so that he could lay on his back, I made myself stand in his field of vision</p>
		
		<p>I could see that he can still see me, I made sure that this poison doesn't take off one's vision or hearing, its a perfect Cultivator slayer poison</p>
		
		<p>"Do you know why I did this to you? Jian Chen? ..." I asked the old man who's eyes widened from disbelieve at seeing me, his prized Disciple responsible for this...</p>
		
		<p>"No you don't... because you are one pathetic man so focused on your Pride, which turned into arrogance, I hated that you took away my choices, I never was interested in this puny little sect, That's why I used your own sect resources to prepare this little experiment which top branch of Sky Sword Sect shall participate... " I showed him one feral smirk " And guess what? You have no choice in this matter...after all, I am giving same amount choices you gave to my family..." I laughed and walked away, I knew everyone heard me, after all, I made sure of this...</p>
		
		<p>Once outside formation radius I did few hand signs, and send a pulse of Profound energy into a formation which activated and combusted every single cultivator into a mist of Blood which was sent instantly into middle of formation which started to form into one very bloody pill, also known as thousand blood pill, a forbidden pill, which gives a very unstable instant increase in cultivation.</p>
		
		<p>Once the formation was done, I entered inside the pavilion where the event was held, there was not a single drop of blood anywhere or even sign of a person, the only thing left is bits and pieces of clothing, what I did I collected their storage rings, and left</p>
		
		<p>Since I knew guards should be arriving soon...</p>
		
		<p>That day I left the Sky Sword sect, with riches of this whole sect, with no elders or Sect Master it will disappear from the map in few weeks maybe months, but I finally got my revenge for myself, and my dear sister as her 'Young Master' is nothing more than a part of this pill...</p>
		
		<p>Thus now my real adventure begins...</p>
		
		<p>Funnily enough, I decided to take Jian as my family named...</p>
		
		<p>After all, if We follow Cultivation rules I am more then worthy such surname...</p>`,
