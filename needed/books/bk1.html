<p>Author Note: Here it is! Finally.</p>

<p>Well, my dear sexy readers here is my second novel, as of now I have four chapters on Patre&oacute;n and will start updating twice daily.</p>

<p>Possibly questions you possible have:</p>

<p>1 - Why didn't you post this before?</p>

<p>Well, I was otherwise occupied with other personal stuff, and I was also working in what I wanted for the time line of this novel, like I did on the GOT one, I don't like posting if I don't know where the novel is going to go, so I make a timeline of events I want to create, from the beginning to the end, meaning I already know how this novel will end.</p>

<p>2 - How many chapters can we expect in Patre&oacute;n?</p>

<p>Well, if you go over answer one, now that I have everything in the timeline ready to be explored, Patre&oacute;n members will get a minimum of two chapters a day. Maybe more but two is what I can promise right now.</p>

<p>3 - Will this one have Harem?</p>

<p>4 - Will there be Ravens on this novel?</p>

<p>Yes... yes they will, the how... is a surprise.</p>

<p>So now that I have answered your questions! here it is!</p>

<p>Look the chaps I have ahead under the Avatar Tag. And enjoy!</p>

<p>As my body slowly woke up, I immediately noticed something wrong. It was too dark, and I knew for a fact that I always left the computer on. And for some reason my bed&#8230; was cold and somewhat wet, this was odd, to say the least, I rolled around and moved my arm to brush the really uncomfortable wetness on my back as my eyes started to acclimatize to the environment, I grimaced in shock as I the situation started to finally sink in, maybe this was a dream, and with that in mind I closed my eyes once again in denial, but as soon as I opened my eyes again with the hopes of finding a different sight&#8230; all I could see and confirm were my original thoughts.</p>

<p>I wasn't in my house anymore, 'How in the fuck I ended up in the artic!' I frantically whipped my head around, trying to find out where I was and more importantly how the fuck I got here, but all I could see was miles and miles of white snow in every freaking direction, and that did not help to alleviate my panic. I carefully sat down, deciding to analyze my situation&#8230;</p>

<p>Was I kidnapped? If so, why would anyone want me in this ice tundra&#8230; did they take any organs perhaps? Was this the way they dealt with people after harvesting them&#8230; No&#8230; this was too expensive and defeated their purpose.</p>

<p>As I pondered what and how, I noticed something, my body was different&#8230; very different, I was white, but my skin was a light brown tone, odd, two I felt smaller, I was normally six foot tall, but right now I kinda felt a foot shorter, while the idea was preposterous and idiotic something in the back of my head told me, this wasn't the body I was used too, 'So this is either a really realistic dream&#8230; or somehow&#8230; some way I ended up in a different body&#8230;.I kinda feel bad for the old guys in my neighbourhood that said they were abducted by aliens&#8230;. Cause I kinda understand them now..' I thought as I stared intently at my hands.</p>

<p>If this was a dream, I was bound to wake up sooner or later, but the lingering thought of this being real was so settled in my head that&#8230; I feared my mind was right, &quot;Well if this is real I will die out here&#8230; so let's see&#8230; where do I go,&quot;</p>

<p>Before I could even decide in which direction I would walk and then die, a sound caught my attention, something was coming towards me, before I could even find where the sound was coming from, something knocked me off my feet headfirst into the snow, &quot;Great&#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>Turning to see what had tackled me to the ground, I found something&#8230; disturbing in front of me, it was cute; I suppose, but unfortunately every feeling I had was overshadowed by my current situation, a probably biologically impossible creature was above me.</p>

<p>It kinda looked like an otter, and a penguin had too much to drink&#8230; and well this came out, now that I think about it I have only seen this in&#8230;. 'Ohhhhh, well&#8230; I suppose that explains the snow&#8230;.' If this was real at least, I knew where I was, in the world of Avatar, awesome&#8230; not the world I would've picked&#8230; but certainly&#8230; not a bad one I suppose, glass half full kind of situation.</p>

<p>I pushed the overly friendly otter penguin off me, as I breathed out in agitation, but something caught my attention, the otter penguin started to slide away&#8230; too fast, afraid&#8230; if I had to guess, taking a deep breath I glanced around trying to see if I was being too crazy&#8230; something was moving&#8230; but I couldn't really tell with everything being white around... 'I swore I saw someth- There!' I narrowed my eyes at the spot, and I saw it. Suddenly yellow dots that I had failed to notice started to move towards me.</p>

<p>'What is that?' I pondered taking a few steps back, and apparently, it was the wrong call, because whatever it was decided to attack, letting out a loud growl, the creature leapt from the snow, and I was finally able to see what it really was, a fucking Polar bear dog, &quot;And I still don't regret not taking that class about surviving in the wild,&quot; I shouted as I tried to outrun a creature that could absolutely outrun me, not exactly my smartest move.</p>

<p>The beast snarled at me, running behind me, ready to eat me. &quot;I don't taste good! I live off trash food&quot; I yelled in fear. However, my screams of terror only made me look tastier&#8230; because. The polar bear dog lunged at me, for a second everything froze in my mind, what did I have around me that I could use?... snow&#8230; can I kill anything with that?, &quot;Fuck!&quot; In panic and knowing I could not escape I decided to go down fighting, I knew many martial arts, and while they were useless against animals, I might deliver some damage, with that in mind I threw my strongest punch at his eye, the fucker would go down one eye after today, I closed my eyes doing this, and all I could focus on were the giant teeth headed my way. The needle-sharp, saliva dripping maw coming to consume&#8230;.And coming. And coming. And..... that sure was a painless death&#8230; or...I have nothing.. brain? As I tried to get an answer, I noticed something was not right&#8230; I could hear a dog whimpering in pain, opening my eyes with hesitation as I looked around, seeing the polar bear dog whimpering, his white fur covered in blood as many ice spikes were piercing his body, &quot;I'm okay with this development,&quot;</p>

<p>As the Adrenaline left my body my head sagged, whatever happened it was me&#8230; if this was really the world of the Avatar&#8230; I might have some bending skills, and by my ethnic looks, water bending was possibly my thing now, the pain started to spread around my body, it seemed the bear managed to scratch me, and under the adrenaline rush, I felt nothing until now, 'Great,' that was the last thing I thought before I passed out.</p>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Waking up for the second time was better than the first, the first thing I noticed was that this time I was on a bed, the weather was still cold but somehow more bearable, then the smell of tea invaded my nose. It took him a few seconds to realize I was inside a tent of sorts from the outside. I could hear voices and people moving, with that I bolted up in surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;Where am I?&quot; I muttered looking around, as my stomach growled all of a sudden, I was starving, but for the looks of my treated wound, I was not a prisoner, &quot;God.. I'm hungry,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh finally,&quot; A tall man with a short beard entered the tent with a wide smile, &quot;I was starting to think you would not wake up, my name is Yuu, how are you feeling buddy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I feel alive thanks,&quot; I smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;Nasty cut you got there,&quot; Yuu chuckled, pointing with his hands to the blood-covered rags he had used to clean me, which brought one single thought to my head, how the fuck was I still alive, that much blood&#8230;. Dear lord.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow,&quot; I gulped in shock.</p>

<p>&quot;But&#8230; we found thanks to the blood,&quot; Yuu smiled, as he served me a cup of tea, &quot;We have some soup if you want?&quot;</p>

<p>I nodded with enthusiasm, &quot;I would love that,&quot; I was hungry, and free food is known to taste better.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, I'll be back,&quot; Yuu smiled, but I stopped him before he left, for I had one question.</p>

<p>&quot;Where am I?&quot; I asked once again, I wanted to know exactly where I was before&#8230; making plans.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, I'd said thirty miles away from the northern water tribe,&quot; Yuu answered as he left to serve me the soup he offered.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose my first order of business is learning how to control my only weapon in this not so peaceful world, water bending can be quite the terrifying power with enough creativity, &quot;Not a dream&#8230; well&#8230; shit,&quot; I chuckle seeing my reflection on a mirror I found in the tent, I understood now why I was smaller, it was for a good reason, by my looks I would say I was twelve or thirteen, instead of twenty-five, &quot;Well&#8230;.&quot; another realization hit me&#8230; I didn't remember my name&#8230;. &quot;Fuck&#8230;&quot;<br>
