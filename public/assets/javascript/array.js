		chapter: `<p> Sitting on the side of the road, Samael doesn't know why he is in this world. Samael Duodere, is the only son of the Duodere family who is an ordinary family in the city of Wahingtong D.C! </p>

		<p> This is a world that is parallel to the earth in Samael's memory, but somehow this world is called Blue Star! even the land is a little bigger than the memory that is on the head of Samael! </p>
		
		<p> Memory? is he reincarnated? maybe!? Why aren't you sure? because his past memories are blurred! </p>
		
		<p> Although the history of this world is not that different from his previous life! </p>
		
		<p> But many characters and cultures are missing! </p>
		
		<p> "But this is a bit problematic ... what is this book? The Request Book? Why do I feel like you've always instigated me to open it for these 4 years?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael looks at the book in front of him while sitting in his classroom chair. </p>
		
		<p> Even though he is not a genius, Samael is still considered smart because he was able to enter Georgetown University which is arguably famous here! </p>
		
		<p> He's currently majoring in business here! </p>
		
		<p> "Ahh - !!! Just open it! even though I feel that my life will change if I open it!" </p>
		
		<p> A bright beam of light charged straight at Samael's body and his vision blurred instantly! </p>
		
		<p> "Yes, young man ... do you not like it here?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael turned his head to see a handsome figure with white hair flowing down his shoulders and back straight. Sharp eyebrows and perfect lips as if he were a character out of the world! </p>
		
		<p> Samael stroked his temple and said, "Don't say that you are a god who will change my future?" </p>
		
		<p> "Yes and No!" answer that person. </p>
		
		<p> Samael sighed and immediately sat down in this pure white world, "The Book of Requests, is it yours?" </p>
		
		<p> The man also sat down and said, "Yes! it's mine. The reason is in your hands, obviously ... I threw it away. I needed entertainment, and it happened that the book fell on your head. No, you're lucky ..." </ p>
		
		<p> Samael sighed again, "First past life memories and reincarnation, then god things like you. You know, I'm quite satisfied with my current life ..." </p>
		
		<p> "I know, but ... you as a human must have ambition, right?" </p>
		
		<p> "I can't deny it ..." Samael propped his hands back and continued looking up, "The Blue Star world, although its history, knowledge, and famous people are mostly the same ... there is something different from the Earth World, Polygamy. . "</p>
		
		<p> The man laughed outright, "Hahaha-! Do you want to become the Emperor with 72 Concubines ?!" </p>
		
		<p> "Hahaha, don't forget ... I'm still young. So God, you won't regret choosing me right? Don't say you'll get bored halfway and pull everything I got later ?!" </p>
		
		<p> "Tsk! You think I, this great and handsome God will do that? If I get tired of you, I just have to find other humans in thousands of other worlds and make them my entertainment!" </p>
		
		<p> "Ahh, you're mean. But I can't blame you." Samael then looked seriously at the person, "So, what is the function of this book?" </p>
		
		<p> The man shrugged his shoulders, "I thought you already knew ... yes, it's called the Request Book, obviously all requests will be granted by him! Unfortunately there is only one request every one year! Isn't that fair?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed bitterly, "For us humans, even if ten years of one wish, we will be greedy fighting over this book. Don't say anymore, the world might be destroyed!" </p>
		
		<p> The person was stunned and patted his thigh and laughed loudly, "I like you brat! well, write your wish first. It's not that I'm good or anything, you've been keeping this book for 4 years. Really, I don't know why you didn't open it for that? "</p>
		
		<p> "I told you, I'm satisfied with this life. But ... you should already know my current state as a god." </p>
		
		<p> "Ahh, I'm so sorry for your father who passed away the day before. You were the only male in the family, one mother and three younger sisters ... I wouldn't say you were noble because of strong affection for your family, but that's human nature. "</p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed bitterly and shrugged helplessly, Samael's father Luric Duodere unfortunately passed away at the age of 47 leaving Samael, his mother, and 3 sisters at the age of 21 years old Samael! </p>
		
		<p> Samael's mother is Helina Viollen, 37 years old! </p>
		
		<p> Still young and virtuous, beautiful, seductive, and very caring for her family! </p>
		
		<p> It could be said that Samael's father was fierce towards his mother, just imagine, Samael is 21 years old, doesn't that mean Samael's mother gave birth at 16 ?! Oh my God! why isn't he jailed! </p>
		
		<p> Samael's first daughter and younger sister named Tilina Duodere, aged 19 years old and just taking his college education! </p>

		<p> But don't underestimate it! she still works side by side as a model! She is very beautiful after all. </p>
		
		<p> The second daughter is Ririca Duodere, 16 years old. Still in high school and loves hanging out with his friends! But he's made money too! by becoming a little Streamer! </p>
		
		<p> Then the third daughter, Finri Duodere, is still 5 years old and is the darling of the family! </p>
		
		<p> Samael touched the Request Book beside him and immediately opened it, only pure white paper was printed there, even though the book is about 800 pages thick! </p>
		
		<p> "Yes, there you are. Write, write your wish and let you cheer me on!" </p>
		
		<p> "Shut up, I'm concentrating!" </p>
		
		<p> << 1. Luck is unlimited !!! </p>
		
		<p> 2. Applications like in the novel World of Entertainment Star Circle that make close friendships with stars in the world! >> </p>
		
		<p> "Oh? World of Entertainment Star Circle, nice step to get rich. With strong friendships with other rich or influential people, you can keep the green light in your business. But only the boundaries in the world of Blue Star and Earth are friends who you can. Although there are some surprises for you later. "</p>
		
		<p> "Plus unlimited luck, if you go to a casino in Las Vegas, you get rich right away! Although I don't know why you didn't write down your third and fourth wishes." </p>
		
		<p> Samael chuckled, "Yes, this is the best move I can think of. The world of Blue Star is not too dangerous, so let me cheat like this ... for my family. For the third and fourth wishes, let me think about it later, make it. in case. "</p>
		
		<p> "Yeah, don't be too stiff. Now, in addition, let me help you save this book." </p>
		
		<p> The Book of Requests suddenly turned into a stream of light and shot straight through the back of Samael's right hand. There you immediately saw a black tattoo with the open book logo on it. </p>
		
		<p> "Then I'll send you back. Remember, cheer me up, well ... I'm also curious about your luck. Maybe when you come back a girl will come to you? Hehehe ...." </p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed too and his gaze turned blurry again. When his vision cleared, he saw that he was currently in the same seat, the difference was ... he was asleep! </p>
		
		<p> "Are you awake? Samael?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael looked sideways timidly and finally sighed, "Liu Yue, don't scare me. Right now it should be Mr. Polus's time teaching, he is very fierce! ... it's Mr. Polus' time right?" </ p>
		
		<p> The woman named Liu Yue covered her mouth and laughed gracefully, "If afraid, why are you sleeping right now? But you are very lucky! Mr. Police just arrived 4 minutes ago, Samael, you are safe!" </p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed awkwardly and he looked at Liu Yue's face. She is a foreign student from China and Samael has known her for 3 months ago. Even though Hot lost to the female figure in America, Lui Yue was still beautiful, her face and lips were rather thin, and her slender eyebrows flew towards her temples, revealing a pair of slender and sharp eyes. </p>
		
		<p> Liu Yue was a little embarrassed to see Samael staring at her face, but she still smiled and muttered: "is it satisfied?" </p>
		
		<p> "No way, if satisfied, can I kiss you?"</p>

		<p>Hello, this is my second original novel. I have written up to 5 novels three of which were dropped</p>
		
		<p>To be fair two of them were the same novel that had a slight difference. The first novel I wrote had way too many problems to count.</p>
		
		<p>The girl on the cover was not done by me nor do I own it either. I found it through google images and edited. If you are the owner please tell me if you'd like it taken down or be credited. The cover will change over time as I either learn digital art or pay some talented artist.</p>`,
		chapter: `<p>In a quaint little home situated in the busy city of New York was an average-looking young man who was quarrelling with an equally young woman.<br> <br> &quot;Don't call me unless it's for Rose and don't try to ruin my career&quot; Shouted the young blond woman<br> <br> &quot;Don't worry, I have no plans to get involved in your life. From this day forward you are no longer my wife, nor are you my child's mother&quot; Said the young brunette man with his fist clenched and his body shaking with pure anger<br> <br> &quot;I'm still Rose's mother&quot; Shouted the woman<br> <br> &quot;You're no mother!! A mother would care and love for their child. Sacrificing a limb if necessary but YOU, you picked the dirty corrupted entertainment industry. Leave now&quot; Said the young man<br> <br> (Note: Plz don't be offended I'm not saying women should be at home. I respect women, read a few lines further down and you'll understand)<br> <br> The Young Lady walked out of the house and left. Leaving only a shadow of memories that left the young man confused.<br> <br> *Sigh* 'How did it come to this. It's for the best. Hopefully, I would never have to see or hear from that bitch again' Thought the young man as he pulls out a small rectangular box from his chest pocket.<br> <br> Opening the small box he pulls out a white cylinder item that was placed between his lips.<br> <br> The item between his lips is a sweet that appears to look like chalk or could be mistaken as a cigarette from a distant.<br> <br> This was something quite the norm for him as this was his method of giving up his smoking habits.<br> <br> He had given up a lot for his family including Alcohol and work. He had given up work to be the rare stay at home dad.<br> <br> The women who just left was the breadwinner of the family, her name was Bethany Hunt now Bethany Jones, after the divorce, it changed back to her family name.<br> <br> The young man who was left to pick up the pieces of his life and his daughter's life is Theodore Hunt.<br> <br> 23 years old unemployed father with average scores and standard C.V. A typical dad bod with a very ordinary face and black crew cut hairstyle not counting his grey eyes.<br> <br> Though he appears ordinary in actuality, he is far from it, he has secret that he has kept since two years ago.<br> <br> Two years ago on the night of his daughters birth, Theodore Hunt died.<br> <br> The cause of death was embarrassingly due to tripping over his untied shoelace and hitting his head at the hospital's receptions desk.<br> <br> That night another man from a similar world took over the dead body of Theodore Hunt.<br> <br> David Johnson was the man that took control over the body. He's a simple white-collar worker that spent most of his free time on the internet or planning a way to make money quick. He abruptly died from an elevator malfunction.<br> <br> There was nothing at all special about him yet by some heavenly luck, he had the luxury to live once again.<br> <br> He was excited at first but he later discovers that he had nothing to bring to this new life of his. Apart from some odd quirks and some new shows to watch it was just another life to live.<br> <br> Although the world shares some similar things like the geography of the world and some historical events they have some very huge changes like the entertainment industry is not at all the same nor is the technology.<br> <br> The entertainment industry isn't bad but a feeling of emptiness is felt from anything he watches, listens to and plays.<br> <br> Technology in this world is leaps ahead with most things running on green energy.<br> <br> Even computers and Mobile phone are mostly made-up of a holographic image and have an incredible picture quality.<br> <br> Their step-in VR technology had already reached the level of being able to place the subconscious in a virtual world.<br> <br> After a lot of backlashes, the technology was banned for the high chance of death and now VR is done with the physical body.<br> <br> And the biggest difference is the presence of powers being considered the norm. It is recorded that powers have existed since the stone age.<br> <br> That does indeed mean powers were present in the world war and it also means that each country had its own historic &quot;Captain America&quot; legend.<br> <br> Even with the presence of superpowers, there is a small number of people that dress up and keep the streets safe.<br> <br> Although this world has superpowers it's normally just a meaningless power. 99.9% of the population will get a power that amounts to the same usefulness as the power Warm Hands.<br> <br> Which as the name entails is the ability to make your hands warm. Powers that have similar usefulness are called Minor-Powers<br> <br> The 0.1% would be the ones that hold powers that are considered a danger to society like telekinesis, super strength, super speed and so on.<br> <br> These types of powers are rightfully titled as Super-powers. Even with the title to differentiate none lethal and potentially lethal power holders only a few certain powers will cause many to be fearful and even be put on a watch list.<br> <br> Theodore Hunt is one of these Super-Power holders with the ability to create 3 identical clones of himself.<br> <br> His cloning ability makes him able to share senses with every clone. If a clone dies they disappear in the form of light particles.<br> <br> Clones do not have human personality but run on a set of instructions that are made by the original body. These instruction are very clear and simple like running, jumping and other simple stuff.<br> <br> This is due to the fact that his brain is unable to conjure up a false personality and is too weak to control three bodies at once.<br> <br> When you find out that you are under the Super-Power criteria you are then to attend a boot camp at 18 where you are taught to mix back into society but in truth, it is a year of military service.<br> <br> The military was keen to have a clone user, so they put him under surveillance before confirming that his personality had no faults.<br> <br> With that confirmation, multiple high ups around the base poured in trying to pull in the new asset into thier regiments.<br> <br> His ability we're immediately seen as making him the best scout and off the grid telecommunications.<br> <br> Theodore learnt everything from Gun Handling, Wilderness Survival, Boxing and Emergency First Aid and so on.<br> <br> He was the perfect soldier with talent like no other. So when it came to the end of one year of military service Theodore was to decide whether to stay or rejoin society.<br> <br> He decided to leave as he had his girlfriend waiting for him. Yes, the girl he left his promising career as a soldier was Bethany the very same women that just walked out on him.<br> <br> He doesn't regret it because what came out of the relationship was his beloved two-year-old daughter Rose Hunt.<br> <br> A short chubby baby girl that can already walk and say a few words.<br> <br> This was quite normal even in his past life but he couldn't help thinking that she was a natural-born genius.<br> <br> Before having the Baby, Bethany was working as a signed artist for a big entertainment company called Heat Entertainment.<br> <br> She at the time had a very a timid figure, average talent and didn't have any real appeal.<br> <br> After giving birth Bethany's body changed with her hips widening and her breast growing to a prominent D cup.<br> <br> After losing the weight she was a curvy goddess that had a mature air surrounding her.<br> <br> Her company immediately took up the opportunity and gave her a small roll in a comedy show in return she had to give up her identity as a mother and married woman.<br> <br> Theodore began to see that his wife was no longer helping in the money situation. All of it was going into her look to be a superstar. Theodore was forced to sell some of his family heirlooms.<br> <br> As time passed she was no longer coming home and just sending the bare minimum through a banking app.<br> <br> &quot;To think she gave us up so easily&quot; Said Theodore sadly<br> <br> He walked towards a bookshelf that was in the living room and pulled out two small cases. Inside were two platinum rings that had a diamond on top.<br> <br> &quot;I spent a fortune on you guys but in the end it meant nothing. Sigh, I need to sell these hopefully the money I get out of it will last a month or two. Now I have to figure out a way to make money from home. This would be easier if I had any memory of my past world. Why do I remember every detail yet whenever it came to any form of entertainment it's just a blur&quot; Said Theodore<br> <br> Walking up a set of stairs quietly he snuck up to a door that had stickers all over it. Slowly turning the knob he peeked into the darkroom.<br> <br> Slowly pushing the door open walked over to the drawn curtains and opened it to allow the morning light in.<br> <br> The light immediately attacked the little sleeping beauty that responded by pulling the blanket over her head.<br> <br> Theodore walked to the baby cot and said &quot;Rise and shine, Rose&quot;<br> <br> The figure bundled up in a blanket began to twist in discomfort.<br> <br> A muffled voice sounded from the blanket &quot;~hmmm NO!, Night Night!!~&quot;<br> <br> Theodore grinned and reached in and tugged the blanket down showing his tired daughter &quot;Come on, wake up&quot;<br> <br> Red blush on her chubby cheeks with her pearl white completion and her blond hair in disarray. Strawberry Blonde like her mother with unique grey eyes that came from Theodore.<br> <br> Adding to all of this was her grumpy little mouth that stuck out showing an angry pout.<br> <br> Rose responded with a cute little nose scrunch and a disapproving head shake. With her eyes squinting she replied &quot;I want Night Night&quot;<br> <br> &quot;That's too bad because It looks like a great day to play in the park but if you want night, night I guess we can't,&quot; Said Theodore exaggeratedly<br> <br> Her eyes opened up in anticipation as she kicked her blanket off and stood up quickly with her hands in the air, she spoke &quot;Up&quot;<br> <br> &quot;Haha,&quot; Theodore chuckled and scooped her up with his hands under her armpits.<br> <br> &quot;Phew, getting heavier by the day you are&quot; Said Theodore as his tickled her oversized tummy<br> <br> &quot;Hehehe, no Heehehe daddy stop it,&quot; Said Rose while wiggling in his arms<br> <br> &quot;Sniff, sniff, good job, no mess today,&quot; Said Theodore as he did his routine check on her nappy/diaper<br> <br> &quot;Yep no mess&quot; Said Rose with a happy smile<br> <br> Carrying her to the bathroom he helped her brush her baby teeth and washed her face. They then sat down on the table to have breakfast.<br> <br> Theodore was having a bowl of cereal and a glass orange juice. Rose was oatmeal that had honey and dried fruits with her sippy cup.<br> <br> &quot;Finish&quot; Said Rose as she pushed the bowl forward and wiped her mouth with her bib.<br> <br> &quot;Did it taste good&quot; Asked Theodore<br> <br> &quot;Really, tasty~,&quot; Said Rose happily while nodding rapidly<br> <br> &quot;That's good&quot; Said Theodore while patting her head<br> <br> &quot;Hehe watch, please&quot; Rose pleaded<br> <br> &quot;Okay remember don't sit so close to the T.V,&quot; Said Theodore as he got her off the high chair.<br> <br> Then went to the living room with Rose following closely behind. Rose sat down on the couch as Theodore put her cartoons on.<br> <br> &quot;Stay far away from the T.V okay&quot; Said, Theodore<br> <br> Rose looked back and said while nodding &quot;Far away&quot;<br> <br> Theodore sat next to her and pulled out a metal rod the size of a pen. Pulling the side a blue holographic image sprung up from the space in between.<br> <br> He found a few answers like the so-called online shop, a writer, artist and an online influencer.<br> <br> Online shopping needs investment and money, he has none of those things. A writer needs the creative ability to create a story worth reading, no use his imagination has been<br> <br> This leaves online influencer it's has a lot more freedom and could be easily done from home.<br> <br> Doing some basic research he found a popular streaming platform that went by the name of WideView. Then he found that they generously allow for newcomers to keep 100&#8453; of the donation they gain for the first two weeks.<br> <br> After that streamers would be only getting 40% until they manage to get partnered where it would then change to 50%.<br> <br> He quickly went through the sign up before coming to halt as he was asked to make a name.<br> <br> 'Hmmm, what should I go with. It has to be memorable, and unique yet still be easy to spell. . . name? name?. . . ' he thought long and hard before he noticed that his name was being filled in one letter after another.<br> <br> S_I_N_G_L_E_ _D_A_D<br> <br> (Note: The name is up for suggestions. I want it to related to dad)<br> <br> &quot;Wait, no what the F *Cough*,&quot; Said Theodore in a startled tone before looking towards Rose.<br> <br> Thankfully he stopped himself.<br> <br> &quot;But how? Is this a joke? Am I getting pranked by a hacker&quot; Said Theodore loudly<br> <br> &quot;Shush! me watching&quot; Said Rose with a grumpy pout and a finger over her lip<br> <br> &quot;Sorry, princess,&quot; Said Theodore apologetically<br> <br> &quot;It's okay&quot; Said Rose with a pure smile before looking back at the T.V<br> <br> 'Calm down, I can just go back' Thought Theodore<br> <br> &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; PROFILE CREATED &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull;<br> <br> &quot;NO!&quot; Said Theodore while spamming the back button to no avail<br> <br> 'Holly Fuck, everyone's gonna think I'm a creep. My name is literally an introduction to a dating site. . . . It's not too bad I mean it's definitely unique and memorable. . . who am I kidding this is bad' Thought, Theodore<br> <br> While in his moment of confusion and anger with himself and to whoever had messed with him a deafening noise sounded.<br> <br> *DING*<br> <br> At the sound of the noise, he instinctively blinked in shock. When he opened his eyes again he saw something floating in the corner of his vision.<br> <br> &quot;Huh??!!!&quot; Said Theodore in a confused and startled tone</p>`,

		<p>A Spartan who seemed to be no more than 25 years old spoke to me, the guy was wearing a cuirass made of several layers of hardened and glued linen, reinforced with bronze plates that were quite resistant to blows. In the area of ​​the lower abdomen he had strips of the same material superimposed, to facilitate movement. He also wore a bronze Corinthian style helmet with a black crest and in his left hand he carried a wooden shield, concave and round covered with a thin layer of bronze to adorn it and to strengthen it, on the legs they wore bronze greaves that covered the leg. below the knee and in his right hand he had a 3 meter long spear with an iron tip and a counterweight, finally a 50 cm long Spartan sword that was used in emergencies. And a red cape on his back.</p>
		
		<p>I remember his name and it was Ezio, a Spartan noted for his intelligence and perseverance. Next to him were 4 more guys dressed in the same way, I was also dressed like that, only I had a red crest instead of the black one. . The tallest was Gregory who was cautious and vigilant, the most muscular was Leo a strong, brave and wild man, the slimmest and smallest who is actually short when compared to the others measuring 1.78 meters called Keelan and finally Tassos who had a scar on his eye he was very thoughtful and rational.</p>
		
		<p>Even if I want to leave, we are surrounded! I thought in my mind and I could only sigh for my bad luck, reborn into a prince I am supposed to relax since I would not have any problem, but now I am surrounded by hundreds of elite soldiers who want to my head.</p>
		
		<p>So knowing that he would die anyway I will try to make it as epic as possible so that my name is remembered in the history books.</p>
		
		<p>I threw myself towards the Persian immortals and as if my body knew what to do with my spear I pierced one, lifted his body and threw it towards the other immortals. The immortals began to counterattack, but they were very weak, I waved my spear making a horizontal cut opening the belly of five immortals who fell to the ground screaming in pain, my spear got caught in one of their bodies I tried to pull it out, but I felt that for me back a spear wanted to pierce me. I tried to raise my shield but an immortal was grabbing it, but before that spear reached me, the immortal collapsed to the ground with a spear that pierced his skull, It was Gregory who was a few meters from me, I wanted to thank him but it was not the moment, I left my spear on the ground and drew my sword and pierced through the mouth of the immortal who was following agpulling down my shield. I pulled the body away from him and continued advancing towards the immortals waving my sword cutting limbs, decapitating. My body seemed to have limitless energy.</p>
		
		<p>Meanwhile Gregory, who threw the spear to defend Maximus, cut with his sword, only beheading cleanly because he preferred to ensure the death of the enemy, he was the most elegant in battle, on the other hand, Leo with his spear pierced 4 immortals and threw them up. , with his shield he blocked the spears that came towards him. Tassos and Keelan also began to stab with their spears, and Ezio who was the smartest while killing immortals was looking for a way out for the prince, King Leonidas made him swear on his honor that he would take Maximus to Sparta.</p>
		
		<p>Everyone knows that for a Spartan death is not something he fears, what if it terrifies them is dying without honor. They long for the blood of their enemies, but they will always follow the orders of their King, which is why they were feared throughout Greece for their ferocity and obedience.</p>
		
		<p>An hour passed, but the immortals kept coming, but we were like lions surrounded by small dogs, although they were quite a few alone, they made us small wounds, I don't know how many times I waved my sword, but I already felt tired.</p>
		
		<p>Prince, the Persians are retreating</p>
		
		<p>Ezio pointed me forward, it was true the Persians were retreating but guys with mystical masks came, I think they are the Persian magicians. He was not afraid of them because according to the story they were only people who knew something about gunpowder.</p>
		
		<p>But I couldn't react to what they did, they took out a piece of paper and put it on the ground and everything under us started to glow and some kind of mysterious rune appeared.</p>
		
		<p>-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -----</p>
		
		<p>Inform King Xerxes that the Spartan Prince Maximus was killed with the holy relic, but after its use it became useless.</p>
		
		<p>The messenger rushed out on his horse</p>
		
		<p>And to think that we had to use it, but it was necessary, we didn't have more time, King Xerxes was too angry, and he wanted revenge for the wound that the Spartan King made him.</p>
		
		<p>After this the Persians withdrew, leaving a field of corpses and in the middle of these an area with rare symbols that still glowed but slowly disappeared.</p>
		
		<p>-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ----------</p>
		
		<p>I feel dizzy and with a fairly strong headache, I opened my eyes with pain and saw the others getting up from the floor with difficulty.</p>
		
		<p>Prince, are you okay?</p>
		
		<p>Tassos seems to have been the first to recover.</p>
		
		<p>Well let's hope the others wake up more see what we do</p>
		
		<p>After ten minutes everyone was awake. We all quickly began to discuss where we are and finally we understood that we were in an unknown place.</p>
		
		<p>While we were planning what to do we heard a sound of a fight a few meters from where we were, it seemed to be the roar of a beast and some screams of some women.</p>
		
		<p>Prince, we get closer to see?</p>
		
		<p>In my mind I was still worried that we are on a desert island, imagine being adrift with five muscular guys, just thinking about it made my hair stand on end. But the sound of the fight gave me a slight hope so I accepted Ezio's suggestion.</p>
		
		<p>So we get ready, adjust our armor, and check that our weapons are in good shape. Leo had to leave his spear because it was already deformed, it seems that this guy needs a weapon that is resistant to demonstrate his full potential.</p>
		
		<p>We adjust our breathing and move in an orderly fashion toward the sound. I took the lead directing the formation.</p>
		
		<p>-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ----</p>
		
		<p>In the trees was a beautiful woman who had pointed ears, golden hair to the waist, marking those dazzling and fascinating curves, on top of her she wore a golden diadem and strangely she was also protected by a silver armor. The face of this woman was very beautiful without any imperfection, her lips were red and soft, her slightly golden eyes gave off the youth of spring. Her bust was plump that would attract the eye of any man and cause several bleeds.</p>
		
		<p>Her beautiful crescent-shaped brows were furrowed which showed that she was quite concerned. She wielded a long bow and shot arrows at the monsters below, in the trees of her near her there was also</p>`,

		originalDesc: '<p>A modern man reborn into World of Cultivation, reaching the top in his own unique way... (Alternative World, replacing original MC, Original powers, Grey MC, self-made Mc)</p>',
		chapter: `<p>(Most of the chapter is MC early life and it's mostly Summary)</p>

		<p>Surely reborn is a great thing, is it? Having that thought that this time it will be different! That you will do certain things differently! Like you wouldn't be shy as much as before! Or you will finally say those words to your dream girl!</p>
		
		<p>Yet for me, it was a different kind of second chance...</p>
		
		<p>First of all, I was not on Earth any more...</p>
		
		<p>How do I know? Well, the moon is too big, and the sky itself has multi-coloured Stars! , yes multi-coloured! and another thing is that people here are all Chinese looking, and building style is that of Ancient China, so when you put those things together and put that extra unique energy everyone is talking about...</p>
		
		<p>You will find out that...</p>
		
		<p>That I am in Cultivation world... should I be excited? Probably? After all, this world has badass Kung Fu moves, probably incredible beautiful women, Icy Queens, and some scheming ones as well... with a bunch of Young 'Always Boner' young master's running around...</p>
		
		<p>So, yes I am excited and terrified...</p>
		
		<p>Excited because there is a chance I can become something more, and terrified that I am born into a Farming household, where my parents know jack shit about cultivation, basics among basic, at least they showed me how to enter into the 'profound way'.</p>
		
		<p>A Very simple procedure, basically people born into this world have something called 'Profound veins', an extra set of veins which exist inside one's body, what I have to do is pull my 'Vital Energy' into these veins, once such thing is done, I will enter into the first Stage of Elementary Profound...</p>
		
		<p>This realm has 10 stages, and once I am stage 10 elementary profound I will be able to break through to Nascent Profound which is considered the first step towards 'Profound way'...</p>
		
		<p>A very cliché if I say so, but unlike my parents and brothers and sister of this world I did something else, alongside simply just sitting in Lotus position and pulling my vital energy into my Profound Veins...</p>
		
		<p>As they mentioned, what is 'Vital Energy'? Well In layman terms its Stamina in 'physical form' or 'Liquid form' I am not a scientist or medic, but that's the only thing I can think off, such thing never existed in my world, But I know one thing to improve one's stamina, and that is Physical training, there is no gym here, but as ex-employee of Gym and SPA, and having friends with P.T and therapists I learned few things how to train and upkeep one's body...</p>
		
		<p>So at the tender age of 8, I started training... and it was time when I learned that I was blessed, like any other Main character of Wuxia or is this world Xianxia? Gods who cares... I got cheats! In terms of very 'crude' system or power depends on view really...</p>
		
		<p>What it does is very simple yet considerate OP as well thing, what I need to do for it to work, is a herb or wood, or metal, then I can access its structure learn its secrets, abilities, or powers, and then I can pull it out, and add it into a thing of my choice, a very broken and powerful ability... what I do not know yet is, is it only for items or can I do it with cultivation related things like techniques ?, since I am reborn into one such world...</p>
		
		<p>But, Of course, I didn't have a chance to test much with it apart of working in Herb field where I was creating a Vitality herb, that's right! I haven't yet broken through to Elementary Profound as I was building up my vitality with exercises, something similar to special diet as well, Funny enough in this world concept of Physical exercise is unheard off...</p>
		
		<p>And so by the time I was 10, I started cultivating, with no modern-day activities or entertainment it was quite easy to fall into such routine, I even started to enjoy meditation and exercises, the concept of this Profound energy intrigued me, is it similar to KI from Dragon Ball? Or is it leaning towards magic?</p>
		
		<p>And so less then Two months Later I had a breakthrough, the feeling was incredible, someone like me from modern who never imagined such power instead relied on technology to do things, was an eye-opener, I can understand how this much power can easily get into one's head, especially into spoiled teenagers heads!</p>
		
		<p>After this breakthrough, I continued to cultivate, and train my body, with my system which I can considerate a mix of gaming like alchemy and crafting I was able to understand more about my Profound Veins, as for next levels of cultivation I will need to absorb Profound energy from Air into my Veins, the thing I found that there are around 54 entrances...</p>
		
		<p>How I found this? Well it's not too hard Since I spend a lot of time meditating and trying to understand Profound energy, one can stumble upon where the entrance is to one body, from there one I worked to understand this concept, how do I open them?, more importantly, how do I control it?</p>
		
		<p>So I started with Herbs I knew around my village, many of them have simple ones, and in the way a short reaction to one Profound energy, from paralysis to accelerating one's healing process, very basic and according to villages healer very common herbs</p>
		
		<p>No people of cultivators would care about such cheap stuff... but for me who can extract that effect and continuously combine to point where it can evolve into greater effect is a gold mine</p>
		
		<p>What I did is simple I made a few very basic pills with each herb, from healing to poison, and everything between, and then I started my hunt for herbs...</p>
		
		<p>By the time of my 12 birthday I finally did it!, no only I achieved Nascent Profound but, I unlocked all of my 54 entrances! The speed of Profound Energy channelling increased several-fold, and my speed of cultivation was increased to the stupendous amount, I knew what I did was incredible, and I will get a lot of attention, so next thing I focused on was creating A profound Art to manipulate Profound Entrances and conceal cultivation if needed</p>
		
		<p>And thanks God's or is it Heavens now? That I did!, as only a few months later did our Village had a visitors from local overlords the Sky Sword Sect, as the name indicates these 'Cultivators' are sword users and they use mostly Sword arts, the man leading this 'inspection' was a man in Spirit Profound Realm, and his minions were in True Profound, a realm after the one I am...</p>
		
		<p>After their arrival villagers started the usual ass-kissing, which led to my exposure, the villagers were far too happy to give me to this Sect for extra resources from them, it was the day I experience this worlds ugliness for the first time, they didn't ask me, neither they cared what I think, and my 'parents'? Well, they even added my sister to mix, fewer mouths to feed...</p>
		
		<p>They didn't even care how dodgy this Sect's reputation is, even we here in this God's forgotten village, know how they treat people who are not of the ruling family...</p>
		
		<p>For someone who was born into a free world, and someone who always had independence from the moment I finished high school, It rubbed me the wrong way...</p>
		
		<p>I already started plotting these people demise, this Sect, and this double-faced Village, They will know not to mess with my independence...</p>
		
		<p>The journey, to this Sect, was short, the compound was just like I expected was a city on its own with hundreds of pavilions, and Hundred thousands if not millions of people living in this place, it's like nothing I have seen before, yes I did live in one of biggest cities in the world before rebirth, but this? It's only a Sect which is considerate average at best... with their Elders being in Earth Profound, and their Master an Early Sky Profound Expert, which basically a realm where one can fly... with their own power, which is incredible motivation actually to reach for me.</p>
		
		<p>Once I arrived there, I was taken to 'proper' Earth Profound expert who inspected me, he was very impressed and instantly took me under his wing, the man instantly said that I have potential to be Elder, as the sect is actually family-based, so I will need to marry into the family and get name Jian added to my one, by the way, my name in this world is simply Feng, that's right simply Feng... to have a surname or house name people have to be quite rich in the first place...</p>
		
		<p>Not that I am planning to stay in this place for long, my master already had that weird Idea that I am already loyal to this Sect... that is the most humorous thing I have ever heard...he took me from my home, and force me to work for them, even look down, on me genius or not... since I am outsider, they even consider me like some livestock...</p>
		
		<p>For next two years, I abused the resources my master gave me, I even learned that he bragged to rest of Elders how he got a 'gem' from some peasant farm for his daughter, and how my sister is nothing like me, and how she is totally useless who will only reach True Profound in her whole life...</p>
		
		<p>That obviously rubbed me the wrong way, with all that nonsense going on she vanished from my life.</p>
		
		<p>The worst part, she WAS already a nothing more than a servant to one of the elders young Master, which is considerate high honour, that comment alone, have put a death marks on this filth, as this master is notorious how he treats his servants...</p>
		
		<p>It didn't take long for me to put things together, and learn her fate, that's why I hate this sect and what hold the main family has... even if I am genius I can't do jack sh1t!</p>
		
		<p>So instead I focused on my main objective, at age 14 my cultivation has reached fifth of True Profound, why so low you ask? Why the reason is easy, I am not showing off to these filths, instead and I am studying, gathering resources, creating a completely new branch of Profound Arts, which is included a proper cultivation method! Why? Because these morons don't have one! According to the Elder responsible for Profound Arts Library is that no one has such a thing! Because all you need is to absorb energy from the air, that was the man's explanation! which was utterly absurd, that's why I spend a lot of time thanks to my 'system' creating a new cultivation method.</p>
		
		<p>And that's right! I figured out my 'system' main point which word similarly like that Novel heavenly library something... only much more bastard version of it, taking bits, and pieces from art and putting together and creating a perfect one from all bits and pieces, something like some sort pillaging and reusing system...</p>
		
		<p>After all the preparation, I was finally ready for my grand plan, what I am about to do would probably earn a good amount of shoulder patting from someone like Darth Sidious, as I about to poison whole Sects top brass, and then to Perform a Profound Formation deployment in inner sect Grounds, which I was setting up for past months, and half, these bastards are so high on their Profound energy that they don't even realise that it's so easy to seal it or even take it away...</p>
		
		<p>People in this world are very, I mean very narrow-minded, everything in this society operates on Profound energy and its given power, and I will exploit that...</p>
		
		<p>Then Night came, I sprinkled the poison I prepared on Food, and drinks, people will consume, because of my status as one of the elders direct students, I was allowed to enter here, the Servant thought I personally overmatching this events food preparations...</p>
		
		<p>The funny thing with this poison is that it has nothing to do with Profound Energy, something which probably never existed in this world before, this poison targets motor control, and neurons in people bodies, turning them into prisoners in their own bodies, once that is done the formation will activate, and they will die...and their profound energies will converge in one point where I will create a very powerful pill for my cultivation...</p>
		
		<p>Then the time came I observed the proud and arrogant bunch of men older in their hundred years bragging about their students, talking shit about their rival sect, until...</p>
		
		<p>One by one they all dropped like flies, it didn't matter if it was Earth Profound or Sky Profound, in end they were still Humans, and humans still have to rely on their brains, the best thing is that I have figured out is, that which part of the brain is responsible for controlling one's Profound energy, and the answer was quite easy, its the part of the brain were senses are understood and commanded from, All I have to do is prepare Poison which concentrates on that part of the body, once it's done I focused making it invisible to Profound energy in one's body, after all its not attacking the energy it's attacking its neurons and motor control...</p>
		
		<p>I could stop myself from not laughing after seeing people which I genuine have harboured hatred at fall like flies...</p>
		
		<p>"HAHAHAHA" I walked over to place where my master was lying down, I kicked him into the side, so that he could lay on his back, I made myself stand in his field of vision</p>
		
		<p>I could see that he can still see me, I made sure that this poison doesn't take off one's vision or hearing, its a perfect Cultivator slayer poison</p>
		
		<p>"Do you know why I did this to you? Jian Chen? ..." I asked the old man who's eyes widened from disbelieve at seeing me, his prized Disciple responsible for this...</p>
		
		<p>"No you don't... because you are one pathetic man so focused on your Pride, which turned into arrogance, I hated that you took away my choices, I never was interested in this puny little sect, That's why I used your own sect resources to prepare this little experiment which top branch of Sky Sword Sect shall participate... " I showed him one feral smirk " And guess what? You have no choice in this matter...after all, I am giving same amount choices you gave to my family..." I laughed and walked away, I knew everyone heard me, after all, I made sure of this...</p>
		
		<p>Once outside formation radius I did few hand signs, and send a pulse of Profound energy into a formation which activated and combusted every single cultivator into a mist of Blood which was sent instantly into middle of formation which started to form into one very bloody pill, also known as thousand blood pill, a forbidden pill, which gives a very unstable instant increase in cultivation.</p>
		
		<p>Once the formation was done, I entered inside the pavilion where the event was held, there was not a single drop of blood anywhere or even sign of a person, the only thing left is bits and pieces of clothing, what I did I collected their storage rings, and left</p>
		
		<p>Since I knew guards should be arriving soon...</p>
		
		<p>That day I left the Sky Sword sect, with riches of this whole sect, with no elders or Sect Master it will disappear from the map in few weeks maybe months, but I finally got my revenge for myself, and my dear sister as her 'Young Master' is nothing more than a part of this pill...</p>
		
		<p>Thus now my real adventure begins...</p>
		
		<p>Funnily enough, I decided to take Jian as my family named...</p>
		
		<p>After all, if We follow Cultivation rules I am more then worthy such surname...</p>`,

		chapter: `<p>In a void, that is filled with darkness. In this place which is described as the embodiment of nothingness. Supposedly, there should be nothing that exists in this space, because everything that is swallowed by the void will instantly vanish into existence.</p>

		<p>This is what it should have been from the beginning. However, this all changed right this moment. In the space where nothing could exist. A humanoid white flickering light could be seen floating. Only a few could identify this humanoid light as a... soul.</p>
		
		<p>In this place that can literally vanish you into nothingness within an instant, this white light was as if the embodiment of light and life.</p>
		
		<p>The darkness that is caused by the void of nothingness, it was trying to vanquish the light. But, no matter how it came closer, it always stopped several meters away from the light. It was as if the void was terrified of getting closer.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Huh?... Where am I?...&quot; A voice sounded from the space of eternal darkness. This was the white light's voice or should I say the soul's voice.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I guess I got stabbed and died saving that girl. I think it's worth it though, dying while saving a beautiful girl. I lived my 20 years of life trying to be perfect. finally, I almost succeeded, but it the end I lost it all.</p>
		
		<p>I deserve this huh? When my parent died I didn't even shed a tear from my eyes or was I either depressed about it. The unbelievable thing is I was even happy when they died. The reason was because I was freed from their beliefs and teachings even though I know, it was for my own good.&quot; The soul sighed</p>
		
		<p>&quot;My family is considered to be rich, my parent's profession was a politician. They always taught me how to be exactly the same as them!. And I hated it as I didn't want to be bounded by rules while scheming others in a devious way to gain advancement by stepping others.</p>
		
		<p>Although there were good qualities about it. But, why can't I seem to remember? Anyway, I don't know why but in that place. Fighting and scheming each other is considered common.</p>
		
		<p>(Note: A politician is a person who is professionally involved in politics, especially as a holder of or a candidate for an elected office also acts in a manipulative and devious way to gain advancement.)</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Well enough of that I regret not following them. And also regret not treating them right because they are still my parents, but what's done is done. I can't do anything about it, they died and I died, that's final.</p>
		
		<p>Oh... right! Where am I? I see nothing but darkness all around me. Will I spend eternity here?.&quot; the soul wondered</p>
		
		<p>A light can be seen in the place that is filled with darkness, it's getting closer and closer to the soul.</p>
		
		<p>This was the second light that shined in the place of eternal darkness. Including the soul that is covered by white light.</p>
		
		<p>The speeding white light's voice suddenly spoke</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Human this is the reincarnation cycle, it is where the soul that has good karma reincarnate from,&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Good karma? Haha, laughable you don't even know of who I am. Yet, you dare say something like that? I was pretty bad in my whole life, being happy that my parents died. Trying to become the perfect someone, to cover the guilt in my heart. Even though what's inside of my personality is as bad as fuck.&quot; the soul laughed</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Indeed your personality was indeed not good, but that doesn't change the fact that you save someone in exchange for your life, and by doing that overwrote your whole bad deeds. In the reincarnation cycle, what matters is what the person did in his/her last moment.&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Overwrote huh? Does that mean I was forgiven just like that? Really-really laughable I was suffering for almost half of my life, filled with regret, blaming myself on how I didn't treat them right! Now, I was forgiven this easy? What was my life even meant to?... worthless!.&quot;</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Worthless? I think your wrong about that human, did you know by pretending to be your so-called perfect self save others, Let's give an example, the guy a whole year lower than you, he didn't have confidence but when he saw and talk with you. he felt warm and gain confidence because you were rooting for him.&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
		
		<p>&quot;S-Senpai do you think I'm a loser?. I always hide when someone talks to me, as I felt like they will hate me because of what I look like&quot;</p>
		
		<p>(He looks like a boy with nerdy glasses and bangs that is always alone)</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Hahahaha don't worry about that. Hmmm... how about we go out and cut your hair, don't always hide behind that hair of yours, that is why people avoid you because they feel that gloomy aura of yours...&quot;</p>
		
		<p>After that, they went to a barbershop together to cut his hair and in a couple of days his aura began to change, he made lots of friends.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Guys, that's my Senpai his the one who always helps and talks to me before...&quot; the boy said when he saw his senpai.</p>
		
		<p>Senpaiiii!!!&quot; the boy run energetically...</p>
		
		<p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Did that really happen? Well, it would be good if it did.&quot;</p>
		
		<p>The soul couldn't help but feel warm when he remembered the boy(Not really remembering, more like picturing it) and when he thinks he had saved him, he couldn't help but feel warm again, thinking that the boy is happy right now. He thought that maybe he wasn't worthless after all even though it is just only one life</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Human it is not only one life you have saved; you saved many lives, that you just didn't know; like the poor guy in the street, you gave money to, he is living, right! because of the measly money you gave him. That man felt pity for himself because he asked money for you and that gave him the motivation to work and earn money&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;You can read my mind?..&quot; He couldn't help but feel uncomfortable...</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Just don't mind that human. I assure you that I won't do anything to you.&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Let me remind you again if you forgot the only biggest one you save was the girl after you died. Stalling the murderer, the police arrived on time to help her, currently, she is praying for you to, Live in peace...&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Her huh?. Well, enough of my life I already felt good not being worthless, knowing all of this. So, what is going to happen to me now?&quot; the soul asked:</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Just like I said from the beginning, this is the reincarnation cycle so you will reincarnate, though more like will transmigrate; you will be living in another's body; you won't be a baby again so relax.&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Transmigration huh...?&quot; the soul asked himself not knowing what to do</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Yeah transmigration, just do what I said and transmigrate peacefully. The world you transmigrate in is interesting, that I assure you.</p>
		
		<p>Because in that world there exist, people call modern magic, you humans hope to be someone like a hero, sage, saint or being respected by the masses right?. In that world, you can be one...&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;W-what w-wait I'm not going back to my world? and also magic?.&quot; The soul was shocked</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Yeah, you won't be going back to your original world, because you can't go to the future, there in your world. Only the past and if you go back to the past, it will cause a butterfly effect. And about magic, it is where you can do supernatural things like having massive strength, speed like the speed of sound and flying, etc...&quot; The light said explaining everything to the soul</p>
		
		<p>(Note: Butterfly effect means doing small things that make the change bigger... for examples if our MC goes back to the past and do things differently it will make the future change)</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Butterfly effect huh? that's not what I have to think right now... I have to think about magic. Magic huh?, it seems like my unreachable dreams are emerging, I always wanted to be strong that nobody can stand in my way. I guess this is a chance, but I feel like I don't deserve a second chance though.&quot; the soul said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Just don't think about that and believe in yourself human, you are human that was given a chance to reincarnate, so don't waste this chance and just take it.&quot; The light advised</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Oh...okay...fine and thanks, I will just forget about the bad things. I will live my life and fulfill unreachable dreams...&quot; The soul said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;That is the spirit human, don't bind yourself about the past and just continue and move forward to a better future. but, don't forget about the past because that is where you learn your mistake and prevent from doing it again.&quot; The light encourages the soul</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Thanks, I feel better now and learned somethings.&quot; The soul was feeling a bit better.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Now that you have decided, I will transmigrate you now, in your new world!!!,&quot; the light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;W-wait, w-wait a minute!!! Do you have any things for me to survive in that world?. What if I don't have magic or an affinity for it? I will suffer again, can you at least give some advice or things for me to survive in that magic world.</p>
		
		<p>As I am right now, I am pretty sure that I will just suffer, surely there are many ruthless people there. And maybe, having no magic will be discriminated on&quot; The soul said in a rush.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Haha, don't be so anxious, human I didn't forget about that I just forgot to explain about it...&quot; the light laughed heartily.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;DON'T LAUGH AT ME I AM SERIOUS HERE...&quot; The soul shouted in a very loud and angry voice.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;OK-OK... let's discuss the matter now, seriously...&quot; the light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I was serious from the start...&quot; The soul mumbled in a very low voice</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I will give you the Unrivaled System, human... this is the best thing that I created when you maxed it out; you will even surpass me a GOD!!!&quot; the God said:</p>
		
		<p>&quot;You are a GOD?!!, I was very curious about this from the start and didn't have the right moment to ask, I know it's too late, but still, let me ask this. Who are you? Why are you being kind to me.? &quot; the soul said:</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Let me answer that, as you have heard before, I am God or should I say the one who ruled the gods and about being nice to you. Hmm... Well, I just think you deserve this, but most of it was just for fun...&quot;</p>
		
		<p>&quot;For Fun?..&quot; The soul didn't understand</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Well as you know there are more people who have done more good deeds than you. I just picked you because you were closer...this is my first time picking though, because minor gods are the one doing this job. You are just lucky, Hahaha.&quot; The God laughed</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I don't know what to think anymore...&quot; the soul said, being speechless.</p>
		
		<p>You mean all of this was because I was lucky? well, damn shit!!! I don't care anymore and just be done with this...</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Let's not talk about it anymore, just explain to me what that system is and after that just freaking transmigrate me.&quot; the soul said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;The system that you said or should I say the Unrivaled System, that I created is a System that can make anything/anyone be Unrivaled, it will guide you to be Unrivaled in this world, like me, I am unrivaled, right now. but still, I have the time to use this system because it was just made</p>
		
		<p>And you, you will use this system and be unrivaled in the whole universe. When you're at your peak, even I can't stand against you.&quot; The God said, he was full of praise about the system.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;If you give this to me wouldn't that be like raising a wolf. In the end, it will bite you...&quot; The soul said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Haha, that is what I want, because being unrivaled in this universe. I've grown tired of it, that is why I'll make you my inheritor.&quot; The God said happily</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Why me though?.&quot; The soul asked</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Because you're lucky...&quot; The God said bluntly</p>
		
		<p>&quot;...&quot; The soul was stunned</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Enough talking, we don't have time, now. As I still have something to do. I will give you a drop of my blood, this will make you more stronger. Although it will be locked, for now, it will unlock by itself little by little as you grow stronger...&quot; The God said</p>
		
		<p>The god then gave the soul a drop of his blood and left with final words before he disappeared and everything was covered by light.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;The system will explain to you how it will be used and always remember this. The World is full of wonders, It also has the unknown and many possibilities that can happen, even the strongest can be the weakest in another place, so don't get too full of yourself. If you have great power, always be cautious, don't abuse your power too much because: &quot;With Great Power Comes With Great Responsibilities&quot;</p>
		
		<p>The Soul then vanished in white lights.</p>
		
		<p>The God mumbled in his breath.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Existing in my void? Yet, it was only a fragment of it. Truly, an anomaly. Maybe, he can gain and harness that power. Because even I...</p>`,

		<p>The Earth Kingdom is ruled by strength and fear while keeping it&rsquo;s population miserable ... and on the North Pole, they still live almost like cavemen did. They deserve support from the Fire Nation, even if they don't appreciate it. Those conquered by another will always view their conquerors as pure evil.

		chapter: `<p>When a thirteen-years-old Zuko was allowed entrance to a war council.</p>

		<p>He was instructed to be silent during the meeting, but eventually spoke out against a general's plan of action.</p>
		
		<p>In consequence, an Agni Kai was immediately demanded.</p>
		
		<p>It was actually the Fire Lord Ozai who was demanding the challenge.</p>
		
		<p>But when Ozai tried to burn his son's face, something unbelievable happened.</p>
		
		<p>He saw white and black flames emerging from the fists that were grabbing his wrist.</p>
		
		<p>And a completely different expression stared back at him.</p>
		
		<p>'Where am I?... I recognize this environment! He?! Oh!...'Someone murmured mentally.</p>
		
		<p>Feeling a very strong grip on his wrist slowly overpowering his arm's strength, Ozai instinctively backed off to free himself.</p>
		
		<p>His adversary complied by releasing him from his grasp.</p>
		
		<p>Baffled, Ozai couldn't say what shocked him the most.</p>
		
		<p>The agonizing pain in his carpus from being forcefully twisted, or the insufferable pain caused by the monochromatic blazes still burning his hand.</p>
		
		<p>Scarily, the white flames were leaving scars of frostbite in his flesh.</p>
		
		<p>But after a predatory grin and an audible snap of fingers from the young duelist, the scorching mini inferno extinguished itself.</p>
		
		<p>While Ozai was recovering himself from the ludicrous situation, he remembered who he was dealing with.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Am I supposed to be intimidated by this sudden act of courage?&quot; Asked the Fire Lord arrogantly.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;That is correct.&quot; Replied Zuko.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Do you consider yourself capable of opposing me, without being turned to cinders and ash?&quot; Asked the Lord, while ignoring his right hand protesting pain.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Who knows?&quot; Zuko said grinning but quickly shifted his attention to something he considered more worthy of his focus.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Such arrogance!&quot; Ozai retorted back.</p>
		
		<p>The prince ignored him without a care while conjuring the terrifying flames in his palm, doing what appeared to be, getting familiar with his newfound power.</p>
		
		<p>Ozai chose to ignore this disrespect and continued talking. &quot;But I'm impressed with your previous display, much better than that previous act of weakness and stupidity. Low your guard and submit, I look forward to seeing your future accomplishments.&quot;</p>
		
		<p>&quot;HaHaHaHaHa!&quot; Zuko wasn't able to avoid laughing out loud.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;You are just a fly pretending to be a God! I'm tired of you already. Bow down now! If not, you cannot blame me for taking your life.&quot;</p>
		
		<p>Ozai's face showed his tremendous rage at his firstborn's words.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;What's the matter? Where is all that confidence you showed when facing your own son in an Agni Kai? Do you really see yourself fit to lead our great nation?&quot; Zuko kept ridiculing his father.</p>
		
		<p>Ozai restrained himself from lashing out, and stated arrogantly. &quot;It's a shame really, I was expecting to see you finally surpassing your sister. But there is a limit to how much one can piss me off!&quot;</p>
		
		<p>&quot;When the weak rave this much, it's impressive actually.&quot; Zuko casually mocked him.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Tch! Di...&quot; The Fire Lord was interrupted mid rant, because of his son's unbelievable response.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I'm bored already! Should I be the one to finally end this?&quot; Announced the prince after stopping from playing with his fire, exposing his naked chest purposefully, daring him to attack.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;What's the meaning of this?&quot; Ozai points out his son's insane posture.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Know that I, prince Zuko of the new Fire Empire will show you no mercy.&quot; He declared, oozing determination for a brief moment right before relaxing again.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Now, attack me fully prepared to die!&quot; He dismissed him with a smug face.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Bastard!&quot; He shouted to his son, right before launching a web of lightning chirping so loudly that everyone watching the duel covered their ears in pain.</p>
		
		<p>But the prince just stood there with open arms, calmly closing his eyes while amidst the raging storm.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I'm not finished!&quot; Ozai started mid dash, just before engulfing Zuko in a sea of pure fire at point blank.</p>
		
		<p>Seeing the smoke of destruction made by his attack, he displayed a maniacal grin of satisfaction.</p>
		
		<p>When suddenly, the Fire Lord received a sweep kick that knocked him to the ground, hard.</p>
		
		<p>After the smoke cleared, everyone saw the little prince crouching while pinning the Fire Lord down.</p>
		
		<p>Zuko was chokeholding his father with one hand, and raising up his index and middle finger together on his other hand.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Cease to exist!&quot; Proclaimed the young prince.</p>
		
		<p>Ozai's face became one of shock and absolute terror when his son poked his chest with his previously raised fingers.</p>
		
		<p>A gigantic mass of golden lightning tore through the multiple layers of the ceiling and hit it's marked target in what appeared to be in one one thousandth of a second, blowing out the entire area of the ring while keeping the spectating crowd free from any harm.</p>
		
		<p>Except for some cases of permanent blindness for those dumb enough to keep looking at it when the entire building appeared to be collapsing.</p>
		
		<p>And like this, after the threat appeared to calm down, there in the middle of the obliterated area, getting up from the ground, was a very calm looking Zuko.</p>
		
		<p>With Ozai nowhere to be seen.</p>
		
		<p>Zuko's expression didn't match his trousers' condition, for they were torn and burned to the point of almost exposing his privacy.</p>
		
		<p>The prince stretched nonchalantly and remarked. &quot;It appears that this matter has been dealt with.&quot;</p>
		
		<p>He began walking without a care straight to the exit. Ignoring all the speechless spectators.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually passing by a very sad and conflicted ex-great general, whom he not even wasted a glimpse at.</p>
		
		<p>Azula's POV (11 years old)</p>
		
		<p>Azula tightly clenched her fists as her heart became filled with rage and doubt.</p>
		
		<p>She should have killed Zuko long ago!</p>
		
		<p>But could she really? Wasn't she mistaking his sudden display of power as if he somehow just acquired it?</p>
		
		<p>She can't imagine that he was able to grow to such a frightening degree in such a ridiculous short amount of time!</p>
		
		<p>It simply wasn't possible! Not for him!</p>
		
		<p>Could he somehow be the Avatar that her nation and family hunted for so long? Impossible!</p>
		
		<p>She remembered defeating him in all of their duels.</p>
		
		<p>'No! He must have been acting all along!'</p>
		
		<p>Azula's eyes widened just by considering the possibility.</p>
		
		<p>If she was right, it meant that this might be her first time seeing the real Zuko.</p>
		
		<p>Azula, however, was quietly watching his back leaving the arena.</p>
		
		<p>The fire princess was even contemplating if she should try her luck against him, sure all this destruction must have hindered his abilities somehow!</p>
		
		<p>But she wasn't a fool to risk it.</p>
		
		<p>Zuko seemed to be too calm, not taking any form of threat into consideration.</p>
		
		<p>He has easily surpassed their father in regards to power.</p>
		
		<p>She needs to start scheming on how to destroy him.</p>
		
		<p>And humiliate him, she can't forget about it.</p>
		
		<p>That's what her father always taught her.</p>
		
		<p>She knew, in order to become the next Fire Lord, Zuko would have to make the arrangements to his coronation soon.</p>
		
		<p>Otherwise, his title will simply be as the brutal kinslayer.</p>
		
		<p>But Azula's mind didn't provide her an immediate solution for the problems to come, Zuko's feat certainly will spread like the plague.</p>
		
		<p>Perhaps she can become Zuko's important right hand. That would help in her preparation to his eventual downfall.</p>
		
		<p>'Yes, I will not be inferior to him!' Assured the young princess.</p>
		
		<p>Future Phoenix Emperor POV</p>
		
		<p>After ordering the sages and royal guards to follow his instructions in preparation for his public coronation.</p>
		
		<p>The victorious prince went to his chamber to reflect about his current situation.</p>
		
		<p>'Such majestic power!' He contemplated holding out a black flare of flame amidst his fingers.</p>
		
		<p>Despite its small size, he could feel the air getting hotter by the second.</p>
		
		<p>And his room grew darker, as if all the light was being sucked by the small combustion.</p>
		
		<p>'The power of the sun in the palm of my hand!' As if to make his point clearer, the bottle of water close began to expel visible quantities of steam.</p>
		
		<p>'So... what should I do now?' He questioned while still observing the spectacle of science in front of him.</p>
		
		<p>He tried out the other type of flame he saw before.</p>
		
		<p>A more contained white version of his previous demonstration ignited.</p>
		
		<p>But it produced so much light, that he deduced it was capable of blinding someone else.</p>
		
		<p>Notably, this time his room appeared to become lifeless.</p>
		
		<p>The temperature was dropping just as fast as it rose before. The previous bottle cracked because of the sudden change in climate.</p>
		
		<p>'I know I didn't put enough thought in the &quot;melon lord&quot; matter, but the prick had it coming.'</p>
		
		<p>The prince stopped his bending and lied down on his bed.</p>
		
		<p>'But what about now?' He pondered.</p>
		
		<p>'Should I stop the ongoing war, saving innumerable lives from needles fighting?'</p>
		
		<p>His face suggested that some sort of good hearted feelings were emerging in him.</p>
		
		<p>But it quickly died down. 'Well, that is a more idealistic notion to it all I suppose...'</p>
		
		<p>Instead, a grin appeared on his face. 'No. The Fire Nation has the power!'</p>
		
		<p>'But was that premise wrong? Power is power. Power to do evil...or power to do good. Power in itself is not evil.'</p>
		
		<p>He himself was already OP enough compared to this universe's inhabitants.</p>
		
		<p>He didn't really care how or why he became this strong.</p>
		
		<p>He only cared about becoming stronger.</p>
		
		<p>Bending prowess can give him lots of things, but it isn't the only way of asserting dominance.</p>
		
		<p>It wasn't even perfect. Sure he had Hax-like bending abilities. But is it it's full extent?</p>
		
		<p>'I need to learn how to bend more effectively. If I just count with my enormous reserves of chi, it will be really boring.'</p>
		
		<p>'But, Firebending is indeed an interesting concept.' He acknowledged.</p>
		
		<p>'The proper way to fuel it is physically and emotionally, hinting that it is nature with the greatest potential for evolution of all the other elements.' He began his line of thought.</p>
		
		<p>Like any kid that paid attention to the cartoon series, he knew that there was an ancient art of bending that controlled energy in its purest form.</p>
		
		<p>'The ability to generate lightning was the prime example.' As he spoke a golden current of a billion volts of electricity began crawling around his forearm.</p>
		
		<p>'So how could it be controlled by Firebenders?' He questioned while straining the electrical fluxes enmeshed around his fingers.</p>
		
		<p>After clenching his fist, the golden discharge extinguishes itself.</p>
		
		<p>'Unless what Firebenders truly did was bend energy to form fire and lightning.'</p>
		
		<p>If that were true, who was to say what other forms of energy Firebenders could learn to control?</p>
		
		<p>No one knew how to do it nowadays, and no one really knew much about it, other than the fact that it had supposedly been more powerful than any of the four bending arts that existed today.</p>
		
		<p>All in the Fire Nation knew that it had once existed, but now it was much forgotten or greatly misunderstood.</p>
		
		<p>'I believe Firebending is the true incarnation of &quot;energy bending&quot;. Of all the four bending arts, only Firebending could truly create.'</p>
		
		<p>'Although, other elements may have other ways to control their substances, be it because of new substances within their element that could be manipulated. They could never create something of their own.'</p>
		
		<p>'Waterbenders needed a source to draw their water from. Earthbenders acted just the same. Even Airbenders needed actual air to control, regardless of how rare there might be of places where air was absent, my point still stands.'</p>
		
		<p>The prince smiled, thinking of the nomads that claimed to be detached from all mundane matters.</p>
		
		<p>'Only Firebenders could conjure their own element out of nowhere, our inner energy being a close next contender to my speculation.' He disputed.</p>
		
		<p>His mental ramblings made a lot of sense to him, he stared at the mirror and contemplated his new face for the first time.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I can't believe I still haven't thought about my harem!&quot; Were his first words since entering his chamber.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Because of course I'm having a fucking harem! Quite literally I suppose.&quot; He joked to himself.</p>
		
		<p>But his stare then focused on something heinous in his reflection.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Argh! How stupid could have you been Zuko? Look at this ridiculous mixture between ponytail and shaved head! I need to fix it immediately.&quot; Doing an one-eighty to his previous smug face, Zuko furrowed his eyebrows and contemplated torturing whoever did his hair cut.</p>
		
		<p>He did not even consider that the original Zuko would've committed such a heinous crime.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Oh goodness... I completely forgot about the Avatar!&quot;</p>
		
		<p>He giggled at his remark.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Did I? Why not just send an armada with those giant ships and raid the southern pole just before he is released from ice?... meh, it won't be interesting! The true war hasn't even begun!&quot;</p>
		
		<p>*Hey there! Thanks for reading my work! I hope this chapter is of your liking. I know the story didn't progress much. But while I was writing what I thought was gonna be a large chapter, I recognized that the transition between segments was rather jarring, so only this short chapter for now.</p>
		
		<p>As I previously mentioned in the description of this story. I'm taking a more relaxing approach, the MC is already OP, the only thing that rests for me to do is give my personal teaks to the original story.</p>
		
		<p>Any ideas for girls, powers and actions towards the war is more than welcomed. I might not use anything, but you will have my gratitude for trying.</p>
		
		<p>If this chapter is a mess of grammatical errors, please wait and I'll promptly try to fix it. But for that I need your feedback.</p>
		
		<p>I do recommend on FanFiction.Net &quot;To break the cycle&quot; from marinenerd01 and &quot;War for peace&quot; from Shadow0Fire. They show a more serious and realistic portrayal of the Avatar world. I really like them both!</p>
		
		<p>Thanks as always for your time, hope you have a fantastic day and please stay safe. Bye.</p>`,

		chapter: `<p>Regaining my consciousness, I feel a heavy thudding from my head. I feel as if there's a thick log lodged in the middle of my brain. It's a sharp stabbing.. discomfort.</p>

		<p>I feel fireworks going off inside the inner coils of my brain and an uncomforting grinding stirring up the workings of my mind.</p>
		
		<p>The grinding works its way down from my brain to the top of my neck. What the hell is this?</p>
		
		<p>I contract the muscles of my body in discomfort and feel the blood rushing inside the veins and arteries of my body. It's a weird sensation, to say the least; feeling something active circulating inside the corners of your body having never been conscious of the feeling before. I, however, recognized the sensation because not a minute ago, I could not even feel anything.</p>
		
		<p>Ah, why are my thoughts so jumbled? It's as if there's a training running down through the nerves of my brain triggering anything in its path.</p>
		
		<p>I feel a creamy substance in my mouth. It's milky, icy, and melting down my throat. What the fuck is this?</p>
		
		<p>Holy shit.</p>
		
		<p>It's ice cream. Ah, yes, it's my favorite dessert. Oh, that feeling is comforting. Triggering a nerve and getting exactly the answer I needed without going through a jumble of thoughts. Yes, without having to think, I know this is ice cream.</p>
		
		<p>I feel something different this time. It's.. in my brain? No, wait, it's trickling into my nose. It's the smell of lavender. Lavender&#8230;. Lavender.</p>
		
		<p>What is lavender? Ladender&#8230;</p>
		
		<p>Lavenfer..</p>
		
		<p>What?</p>
		
		<p>Laven.</p>
		
		<p>Lavender.</p>
		
		<p>Why am I so confused? What's wrong with me? Where am I?</p>
		
		<p>Without having time to prepare, I feel pain. Pain.</p>
		
		<p>What is pain? My brain alerting me of danger, threat, or damage within my body. Yes. That is pain.</p>
		
		<p>I'm slowly beginning to recognize everything. I'm re-learning everything.</p>
		
		<p>Why am I re-learning everything? Did I lose my knowledge? How is it possible to learn something you already know about? It's as if my neurons are traveling high-speed scanning every single word I used to know.</p>
		
		<p>In time, the scanning feels as if it's slowing down. Now, my neurons have moved on to analyzing my memories.</p>
		
		<p>Instead of concepts, words, things, it's now thinking about feelings, thoughts, people, songs. The words I scanned are now being used to combine a huge circle that interconnects everything. Happiness, sadness, anger, rage. I feel all sorts of emotions, but the ones that affect me the most are love and&#8230; emptiness? Love, I feel a fuzzy feeling. Emptiness&#8230; sadness? Or is it depression? It makes me feel a pit in my stomach and a void in my heart. It feels so.. dark and.. lonely. I think of the word family and friends and a warm fuzzy feeling lights up my entire body from within. Ah yes, no more of the void.</p>
		
		<p>My thoughts slowly turn into one cohesive unit which consists of my conscious, and my unconscious.</p>
		
		<p>I reach into my deep memories using my consciousness, and my unconsciousness to assist with feelings and instinct.</p>
		
		<p>Okay, yes. What was I doing?</p>
		
		<p>I was at home alone, dragging my sixteen-year-old lazy ass into doing chores and homework. It looked like a groggy scene. The room was horribly messy, the windows were shut, the shades were down, and there was no light. My hair was covering my eyes and I was unable to see more.</p>
		
		<p>Okay, since I can't see, what did I feel? My unconsciousness helps me by giving me a feeling of void.</p>
		
		<p>Ah, I see. I wasn't a lazy ass, I was just sad and empty.</p>
		
		<p>My apologies, past self.</p>
		
		<p>I feel my consciousness reach into my ears. Ah, I can hear it now. It's rain.</p>
		
		<p>It's relaxing, to say the least.</p>
		
		<p>So I wasn't really that sad and empty of a person. I was just&#8230; is there a word for this? Oh, okay yes! I was in my feels.</p>
		
		<p>Why?</p>
		
		<p>Oh, okay. I saw my ex that broke up with me 11 months ago with a new boyfriend.</p>
		
		<p>And.. I was sad. That's illogical. I was sad when she broke up with me but I moved on two weeks after.</p>
		
		<p>Oh, wait, no, I didn't. That was my past self's lies to cover up his own heart. I did not move on.</p>
		
		<p>Without knowing, I looked for a rebound. Huh, that's pathetic.</p>
		
		<p>Why did I not just talk to her again and try to win her back?</p>
		
		<p>Oh? Because the relationship was in the dumps anyway? Mm, I do not understand.</p>
		
		<p>Ah, I misplaced the feelings I had for my ex to my rebound? Huh, the rebound wasn't even in a relationship with you.</p>
		
		<p>Oh, it was to distract myself from her?</p>
		
		<p>Thinking about them, I feel an intense urge to vomit, cry, and hole myself up forever in this darkness.</p>
		
		<p>Within my core, I feel a void quickly spreading and numbing my thoughts.</p>
		
		<p>There's a heavy cloud over everything. I can't think anymore.</p>
		
		<p>Why is everything so dark and depressing?</p>
		
		<p>I shoo the clouds away.</p>
		
		<p>If you were so sad, why didn't you shoo the clouds away?</p>
		
		<p>Oh, it's not that easy? I see.</p>
		
		<p>Why was I so sad anyways?</p>
		
		<p>Oh, within two months my girlfriend and rebound both left me in the dumps. I distanced myself from your friends because they didn't seem to care about my problems?</p>
		
		<p>It doesn't sound that bad. Oh, the sadness affected my school life, relationships, and my performance in anything that I used to be good at; thus spiraling down into darkness. Okay, I understand.</p>
		
		<p>Hmm, I started stereotyping every single female? Isn't that just a trauma? It doesn't seem too valid to develop a trauma though. Oh, I did it to shield myself from hurting that much ever again? Okay.</p>
		
		<p>I think I'm getting a hang of it now.</p>
		
		<p>I fast forward and now it seems like I'm walking on the streets. Stupid. Why are you walking outside if it's raining?</p>
		
		<p>It helps to clear thoughts?</p>
		
		<p>Huh, it would be cool if I could just know all of this without having to keep asking myself and awaiting a trigger from my neurons.</p>
		
		<p>So how did I move from this scene, into the pitch-black hole where I am currently?</p>
		
		<p>Awaiting a flash of memory, instead, what greets me is a horrifying sound that disrupts the calm atmosphere.</p>
		
		<p>[Ding!]</p>
		
		<p>ARGH WHAT THE-</p>
		
		<p>It's like a blind old man regaining his sight after decades of not seeing and being flash banged just moments after. That's how it feels like but with my ears. My hearing sense was overloaded.</p>
		
		<p>[Ding!]</p>
		
		<p>MOTHERF- STOP.</p>
		
		<p>[DING!]</p>
		
		<p>YOU NASTY SACK OF SH-</p>
		
		<p>[The system congratulates the host on winning the giveaway!]</p>
		
		<p>I WILL KILL YOU.</p>
		
		<p>WHAT STUPID GIVE AWAY? ARGH, STOP BEING SO LOUD.</p>
		
		<p>[Ding! Ding! Ding!]</p>
		
		<p>STOOOOOOOO-</p>
		
		<p>[Rejoice host! For out of the billions of candidates, only you were chosen as the sole owner of the Achievement System!]</p>
		
		<p>What stupid system? Why are you so loud?</p>
		
		<p>I could not help but be sore. I was calmly analyzing my memories and getting an understanding and now everything from myself was being overloaded. However, what put me more in turmoil is that my conscious and unconsciousness were both yelling, screaming, screeching, and crying that this was not logical at all.</p>
		
		<p>I feel overwhelmed.</p>`,

		chapter: `<p>Ye Sato, a poor guy living in the slum. Well, not anymore, his destiny is about to change.</p>

		<p>[The Touch Corpse System is activated!]</p>
		
		<p>Hearing an emotionless voice, Ye Sato woke up. The first thing he saw was a transparent screen.</p>
		
		<p>[Ability]: [Fightmanship: Lv3]</p>
		
		<p>[Function]: [Travel],&#8204; &#8204;[Touch]]</p>
		
		<p>He rubbed his eyes and thought he was still half asleep.</p>
		
		<p>How else could you explain this transparent screen in front of him and it looks very much like those fiction systems.</p>
		
		<p>Furthermore, it's not the first time he had dreamed of getting a system.</p>
		
		<p>After his mind cleared up, he checked if the transparent windows had disappeared.</p>
		
		<p>He sat straight up in the bed.</p>
		
		<p>Looking at the transparent window, in front of him, Sato was excited. His life can finally change!</p>
		
		<p>At the age of 13, his parents died because of the cold winter. Since then, he had been struggling to live in the slump. Barely surviving on leftover food he picked from the trash and the stuff he found in the dumpster.</p>
		
		<p>Yes, he lied about his past, but that's not his fault!</p>
		
		<p>Isn't it a norm to have a sad past?</p>
		
		<p>Well, at least he didn't lie about his parents.</p>
		
		<p>Never mind that, let's get back, to where we were.</p>
		
		<p>Breathlessly, he taped the status screen and when he touched the stat square [Power], information surged in his mind.</p>
		
		<p>[Power]: The strength of the body. The strength in the muscle.</p>
		
		<p>A very simple and clean explanation. He then taped the other stats square.</p>
		
		<p>[Defense]: The toughness of the body. The toughness of the skin, muscle, bone, etc.</p>
		
		<p>[Energy]: The endurance of the body. The sustainability of physical activity.</p>
		
		<p>[Sensory]: The information the body receives. The reaction speed, smell, sound, etc</p>
		
		<p>[Will]: The psychic strength. The mental capacity.</p>
		
		<p>[Power], [Defense], and [Energy] are common stats and very easy to acquire, while [Sensory] and [Will] are rare stats and very hard to acquire. There are also hidden stats, but those stats need hidden conditions to acquire.</p>
		
		<p>The average human stats is 10 points. Three of his stats are lower than an average human. The reason is not hard to guess. He is malnourished, but his [Sensory] exceeds more than twice an average human, and [Will] is more than triple times an average human! This should make up for his disadvantage, right?</p>
		
		<p>After grasping this information, he tapped on the rest of the squares.</p>
		
		<p>[Talent]: A genetic, innate, attained, endowed, or awakened power.</p>
		
		<p>[Ability]: A measure of knowledge. Once knowledge reaches a minimum point, an ability will manifest.</p>
		
		<p>[Fightmanship: Lv3]: Fighting experience.</p>
		
		<p>The level represents the mastery of an ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv1]: Beginner. Barely grasped the ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv2]: Elementary. Grasped the basics of the ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv3]: Intermediate. Grasped most of the ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv4]: Advance. Grasped the ability fluently.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv5]: Master. Mastered the ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv6]: Grandmaster. Exceed the ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Corpse Coin]: Dropped from the corpse. Can be used to unlock, activate, and use system functions.</p>
		
		<p>[Function]: The system function. Can unlock new functions with [Corpse Coin].</p>
		
		<p>[Travel]: Can travel to specific or random anime dimensions. Coordinate: [Ye Sato World] Cost:100.</p>
		
		<p>[Touch]: Touch the corpse to randomly acquire stats, [Talent], [Ability] or [Corpse Coin]. Inanimate corpses will automatically drop upon death. Cost:0.</p>
		
		<p>It cost 100 [Corpse Coin] to activate the function [Travel] and he had exactly 100. Without any hesitation, he thought about activating [Travel].</p>
		
		<p>[Possess only the current world's coordinate. Can't choose to travel to another anime dimension since there's no known coordinate.]</p>
		
		<p>[The system will generate a random coordinate.]</p>
		
		<p>[Generating a random coordinate.]</p>
		
		<p>[Coordinate [Highschool of the Dead] acquired!]</p>
		
		<p>[Do you choose to travel? [Yes] - [No].]</p>
		
		<p>[The travel choice will expire in 10 minutes if no choice is made.]</p>
		
		<p>He had seen this anime before and he had quite a big impression of it. This anime is nothing more than a fan service anime and for those who say there's a plot, he can only give them one answer: hehe.</p>
		
		<p>Ye Sato rumbled around his small cabin.</p>
		
		<p>He dressed in a tracksuit, to make it convenient to move, collected some clothes, drinks, and foods in a backpack. And since he's going to a zombie world, of course, he can't forget about weapons. The only weapons he has are some kitchen knives and a 7 kg metal staff.</p>
		
		<p>He left the knife and chose the 7 kg metal staff since it's more durable and has a longer range. Bringing those knives will only be a weight burden.</p>
		
		<p>He looked at the remaining time: 4 minutes left. Looking around for the last time, he had not forgotten anything and was ready to go.</p>
		
		<p>Without hesitation, he chanted [Yes] to travel in his mind.</p>
		
		<p>Highschool of the dead, here I come!</p>`,

		originalDesc: `<p>Hunted for possessing a heaven-defying object, Yun Che is a young man in both that life and the next. Throwing himself off a cliff to spite his pursuers, Yun Che is reincarnated as Xiao Che, a recently poisoned teen in another realm. Just as hated in this life as the previous one, Che must overcome his own hostile clan, his own inability to cultivate, and his own frosty fianc&eacute;e.</p>`,
		chapter: `<p>Yun Che&rsquo;s consciousness gradually awakened.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s going on&#8230; How is it that I have not died? I vividly remember that I jumped off Cloud's End Cliff, how can I still be alive! Somehow my body is not in pain&#8230; And I do not even feel the slightest discomfort? How is this happening?</p>
		
		<p>Yun Che suddenly opened his eyes and quickly sat up. He found himself in a comfortably soft bed, with a red banner hanging above him, rendering a festive atmosphere.</p>
		
		<p>&ldquo;Ah! Little Che! You&#8230; You woke up!&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>A girl&rsquo;s gasp of surprise was heard from his ear and the same girl appeared in his line of sight.</p>
		
		<p>At a glance the girl dressed in green looked to be fifteen to sixteen years of age. She was as fair as snow with charming rosy lips and a delicate nose. A touching look of deep surprise was expressed by eyes as clear and transparent as a pool of translucent spring water. Her face exuded a dazzling gentleness and softness. At this young age, she already exhibited such charm, so who can possibly imagine what sort of beauty she would be in the future?</p>
		
		<p>Staring at the nearby girl, Yun Che took a closer look and unconsciously let two words escape his lips, &ldquo;Little Aunt?&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>The fair girl lifted her jade-like hands onto Yun Che&rsquo;s forehead and relaxed soon after. With a joyful expression, she spoke, &ldquo;How delightful, your temperature is almost back to normal. You nearly scared me to death. Little Che, are you okay? Tell me if you feel uncomfortable anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>In the face of the girl&rsquo;s eyes that filled with deep concern, Yun Che woodenly shook his head. He stared openly into space with a vacant gaze.</p>
		
		<p>&ldquo;Rest here for a while, I&rsquo;ll go and tell your grandpa that you&rsquo;re awake. Today is your day! When you fainted, your grandfather almost went crazy and personally went to find Doctor Situ for you.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>The girl was in such a rush that she did not notice the abnormality of Yun Che&rsquo;s current state. She pushed Yun Che&rsquo;s shoulders, signaling him to lie back on the bed and hurriedly left.</p>
		
		<p>As the door shut Yun Che sat up on the bed, hands clutching his head.</p>
		
		<p>This was one of the cities in the far east located in one of the Seven Empires of the Profound Sky Continent&mdash;Floating Cloud City. And he was the only grandson of the fifth elder of the Xiao Clan&mdash;Xiao Che! He had just turned sixteen this year.</p>
		
		<p>That was his current identity.</p>
		
		<p>Suddenly, his memory overlapped with the Azure Cloud Continent&rsquo;s twenty or so years of memory and he burst into confusion.</p>
		
		<p>If I am Xiao Che&#8230; Then why do I have memories of the Azure Cloud Continent?</p>
		
		<p>Is it because I traveled to this body after I died in the Azure Cloud Continent?</p>
		
		<p>No! I am obviously Xiao Che! This entire room is familiar to me and I clearly remember all the events of my childhood. Everything from my memory was from personal experience and there is no way I would steal another&rsquo;s memory!</p>
		
		<p>Then was everything from the Azure Cloud Continent all just a dream? Was it only after I jumped off Cloud's End Cliff that I truly woke up?</p>
		
		<p>But the memories of living in Azure Cloud Continent were as clear as day. How could those twenty-four years of love and hatred be only just a dream!</p>
		
		<p>What the hell is going on?</p>
		
		<p>Yun Che&#8230; The current Xiao Che stilled for a long time as he slowly calmed down and settled his thoughts.</p>
		
		<p>It was still early in the morning and the sky had not fully brightened. Today was his and Xia Clan&rsquo;s big wedding day. Two hours ago he was woken up by his Little Aunt and put on his red wedding robe. He ate the porridge his Little Aunt personally made and lost all the strength in his body. He did not remember anything that happened after that.</p>
		
		<p>He did not wake up until now.</p>
		
		<p>A strange smell came from his lips and Xiao Che&rsquo;s lips tucked slightly. His expression darkened.</p>
		
		<p>This is&#8230; Murdering Heart Powder!!</p>
		
		<p>In those years that he lived on the Azure Cloud Continent, with the Sky Poison Pearl in his body, Yun Che learned about all the poisons present in the entire world and it could be said that there was no poison he was not familiar with. He could identify a poison&rsquo;s name and effect with just a whiff. At the same time, because the Sky Poison Pearl, he was impervious. He could not be hurt by any poison, no matter how toxic it was.</p>
		
		<p>Murdering Heart Powder was made by combining a unique soul grass and the purple striae from a cherry-apple tree. If dissolved in water, the poison was colorless and tasteless. A person would lose his life ten seconds after the poison entered the body and no one would know the cause of death for it was also a traceless poison.</p>
		
		<p>Xiao Che&rsquo;s eyes clouded over and instantly understood what had happened.</p>
		
		<p>In fact, he did not really faint. Instead, he drank the porridge containing the Murdering Heart Powder and was poisoned to death! He was born in the Azure Cloud Continent but after he leapt off Cloud's End Cliff&#8230;. he was actually reincarnated in this world inside a dead body!</p>
		
		<p>If one were to hear this, it would sound like it was a fantastical story, but that was the only reasoning Xiao Che could imagine!</p>
		
		<p>Wait a minute&#8230;. if it really was like that, then this body should have no antitoxin ability. How come he was safe from the Murdering Heart Powder on his lips when the previous body&rsquo;s owner died not too long ago?</p>
		
		<p>A slightly strange feeling came from the palm of his left hand. Xiao Che lifted his left hand and was surprised to find that there was a circular green imprint on his palm.</p>
		
		<p>This shape, this color, this size&#8230;. was clearly the same as the Sky Poison Pearl!</p>
		
		<p>Before jumping off Cloud's End Cliff, he had desperately swallowed the Sky Poison Pearl but he did not actually know what would happen to him. This mark on his hand was unexpectedly the Sky Poison Pearl and it actually crossed over with him to this world!</p>
		
		<p>As if in a trance, Xiao Che stared at the Sky Poison Pearl and subconsciously whispered. &ldquo;Sky Poison Pearl&#8230;.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>As his voice dropped off, the green mark on his palm suddenly released a green light. Immediately, a slight dizziness came over him and he unconsciously closed his eyes. When he opened them, his entire world was flooded in green.</p>
		
		<p>This world of green was wide and open. There were no boundaries to be seen and there was a faint aura of the Sky Poison Pearl throughout this space. After a long daze, Xiao Che understood, that he had entered the world inside the Sky Poison Pearl.</p>
		
		<p>Who would have thought that inside the Sky Poison Pearl, there would be such a wide and open world! What was even more unimaginable was that after he&rsquo;d eaten the Sky Poison Pearl without thinking of the consequences, the Sky Poison Pearl had actually traveled along with him, and even seemed to have become a part of his body.</p>
		
		<p>If there was a way in, there had to be a way out.</p>
		
		<p>Xiao Che closed his eyes, and concentrated his thoughts. Suddenly, the world of green hastily dissipated, and when he opened his eyes again, in his vision, was the room he was familiar with.</p>
		
		<p>Staring at the faint green mark in his palm, Xiao Che slowly smiled&#8230; Even though it was not known why this ridiculous event occurred, not only had he reincarnated, but also retained memories from both lives. Maybe, even the gods couldn&rsquo;t watch the suffering of the two lives, took pity, and gave him a chance to live again!</p>
		
		<p>Yun Che was the victim of persecution from Azure Cloud Continent&rsquo;s countless strongest individuals. Although he died in the end, he shook the world by himself; how awe-inspiring and astonishing was that! However, his body right now, was only average&#8230; no, speaking without restraints, it could be considered the epitome of weakness.</p>
		
		<p>In the Profound Sky Continent, profound strength was most important. Although Xiao Che was born in the Xiao Clan, and was even the grandchild of the strongest Fifth Elder Xiao Lie, his profound strength was still at at the first level of the Elementary Profound Realm even though he was already sixteen. He started training when he was seven and half, entered the first level of the Elementary Profound at the age of eight, and then didn&rsquo;t improve for an entire eight years. He was mocked by all of Xiao Clan. Afterwards, Xiao Lie invited Floating Cloud City&rsquo;s top class doctor Doctor Situ to examine his body, and shockingly found that Xiao Che was born with damaged profound veins. The damage was so severe that it was almost impossible to recover from. In this state, Xiao Che would stagnate at first level of the Elementary Profound Realm, and could never improve further no matter how hard he worked.</p>
		
		<p>Even if he trained with his life on the line, he would stay at first level of the Elementary Profound Realm his entire life. This kind of person was unquestionably the lowest existence in the Profound Sky Continent, and was a total laughingstock within the Xiao Clan. If not for his grandfather Xiao Lie being the strongest in Xiao Clan, who also could even be said to be the strongest in the Floating Cloud City, no one would bat an eye against him.</p>
		
		<p>Xiao Clan was one of the three major families that trained in the ways of the profound in Floating Cloud City and has limitless strong entities. In the large number of youths coming forth from the same generation, Xiao Che could be said to be an unnecessary existence. Even if he died some day, not many except a few would care. But there were some today that actually tried to murder him using the extremely hard to obtain and expensive Murdering Heart Powder. Xiao Che clearly knew the reason why now.</p>
		
		<p>Because today was the wedding day between him and Xia Qingyue.</p>
		
		<p>Xia Qingyue, being the same age as him, was also sixteen. However, at such a young age, her profound strength was stated to have reached the tenth level of the Elementary Profound Realm, almost breaking out of the elementary level and stepping into the Nascent Profound Realm. She was the only one in a hundred years that had reached this level of profound strength at the age of sixteen in the Xia Clan. There were even rumors that if she continued to develop this way, she would be the first person in the history of the Xia Clan to ever step into the Earth Profound Realm a few decades later&#8230; or may even be able to reach the Sky Profound Realm that no one in Floating Cloud City had even thought of reaching in the past few centuries!</p>
		
		<p>More importantly, she was not only shockingly astute, but also extremely beautiful, and was considered to be the most beautiful girl by all of Floating Cloud City. All of Floating Cloud City&rsquo;s youths with some level of competency drooled over her. If the Xia Clan started looking for grooms, the line waiting would probably be long enough to stretch between the south and north gates of Floating Cloud City.</p>
		
		<p>This pinnacle of a girl with both intelligence and beauty in the Floating Cloud City, was actually marrying the generation&rsquo;s most worthless youth with no future at all. Who knew how many people were stomping their feet in anger and jealousy&#8230; This was wholly a case of a dazzling lotus flower planted on a pile of manure that no one would even bother to look at.</p>
		
		<p>The ones that had unrequited love for Xia Qingyue of course held both extreme jealousy and hatred towards Xiao Che. Even more were unwilling to give up&#8230; and would try to assassinate him by poison. As the current Xiao Che thought about it, this situation didn&rsquo;t seem to be bizarre at all.</p>
		
		<p>&ldquo;Women are really the root of troubles.&rdquo; Xiao Che got off the bed, stood up, and soliloquized. But as he thought of the beauty and charm of Xia Qingyue that could tip over a whole city, he opened his mouth and laughed heartily, &ldquo;Still, I get to marry such a bride, this really is a good beginning.&rdquo;</p>`,

In addition, he also came to discover that he was gifted with a miraculous system.<br><br>Defeating monsters and frantic animals, Theo climbed into his cultivation, turned into a golden fox and conquered a Goblin village.',
		chapter: `<br><br>"Huh? Damn it started raining!" Theo exclaimed as he left the convenience store.<br><br>Not imagining that it would start raining when he left home, Theo ended up not bringing an umbrella with him. And the money he had, he ended up spending it, so even if he's in a Convenience Store he didn't have the money to buy a new umbrella.<br><br>"I'm not going to wait, I'm going home and running." With that thought in mind, Theo starts running toward his house.<br><br>But on the way to his house, he hears a loud thunder noise thunder coming from the sky.<br><br>"W... What? The...

But he could not get used to the idea of ​​eating something raw...<br><br>Theo: "Now that I have become an animal, it is likely that I will only eat raw meat anyways. Now that things have come to this, I can only accept it." Seeing that things have come to this point and that his hunger was great, he has accepted his fate.<br><br>Theo approached the dead Rabbit on the ground. And he opened his mouth and began to nibble on the Rabbit. Even while feeling repulsed, he continued to eat. Since he was very hungry right now.<br><br>"Mm, after eating a little, I see it's not as bad as I imagined... this can only be because I'm not human anymore."<br><br>When he finished eating the whole Rabbit a transparent blue window appeared in front of him, very similar to the one on the head of the Red fox.<br><br>[Skill <Devour> Unlocked]<br><br>Devour: When using this ability, you can turn it into [Essence] or [System Point]<br><br>Theo: "What is this crazy thing? Where did this blue screen come from? Is that a gaming system screen?" He had already thought about it, but seeing it appear, he began to believe that it really looks like a game screen.<br><br>He then began to wonder whether if while dying and reincarnating as an animal, he ended up obtaining a game system. He was so excited about this that he began to think it wouldn't have been that bad to have died.<br><br>"Can I see my status?" He thought.<br><br>The moment he thought of status. A blue screen reappeared.<br><br>Cultivation: 1st Tier of the Apprentice Kingdom: Small Advance.<br><br><Devour> (Active) Maximum Level<br><br>"Hahaha! It really worked!" Theo was very happy, seeing the status bar that appeared. He didn't start jumping from joy at that moment because his body was still very weak and he was inside a narrow Den.<br><br>"I'm on the same layer of cultivation as the Red fox that brought me the Rabbit..." Theo thought after seeing his status.<br><br>"Ah?! I have an affinity with Lightning and Darkness? How do I use this?" Seeing that in his status it said that he possessed an affinity with Lightning and Darkness. Theo moved his left paw towards the bar, where it said his affinities. The moment he did this, another information bar came up.<br><br>[Affinities: Beings that are born with affinities can form a magic core in the 4th Layer of the Apprentice Kingdom]<br><br>"Oh! So that's something I can use when I get to the 4th Tier of the Apprentice Kingdom." Even though he was very curious about everything that's happened to him, Theo decided to sleep since he felt tired and sleepy, and after waking up again, he thinks about what to do.<br><br>"Haa~" While listening to the noise of nature and the birds singing, Theo woke up.<br><br>This time, when he woke up, Theo did not feel as weak as before. With a good night's sleep, he felt better. He then stands up, realizing that the Red fox was not in the Den and he decides to leave the Den too.<br><br>Leaving the Den, Theo noticed that he was surrounded by gigantic trees, there were also many plants and flowers. Walking through the forest slowly and cautiously and after going past many trees... Theo saw an open field and he saw that that field had many Rabbits.<br><br>Above the heads of the Rabbits, Theo noticed that they did not have the cultivation bar.<br><br>"They don't seem difficult to kill. Unlike when I looked at the Red fox, towards these rabbits, it doesn't say they have cultivation!" He thought.<br><br>Seeing that the Rabbits continue to nibble the bushes. Theo crouched in the bush and began to crawl towards 2 Rabbits that were not too far from him, getting close to the 2 Rabbits. About 4 to 5 meters away ... the Rabbits ended up noticing him and began to run for their lives.<br><br>Seeing this, Theo started running after 2 Rabbits. He was running awkwardly since he wasn't used to his current form.<br><br>"These Rabbits are fleeing too fast! And I'm not yet used to this body..." He thought.<br><br>After running for a long time behind the Rabbits, Theo began to get a little used to his current form and managed to reach one Rabbit. He ended up killing the Rabbit the moment he put his fangs on the neck of the Rabbit. And soon he began to feel a taste of the rabbit's blood in his mouth.<br><br>"It does not look like I get exp killing..." He thought, while sad.<br><br>"Ah! I had gained the ability to devour. I'll test it on this Rabbit." He then recalled that he had gained this ability while he was eating the Rabbit, which was given by the Red fox. So decided to test it on that Rabbits.<br><br>Saying "Devour" in his mind, Theo was able to use his ability.<br><br>Then, something far beyond his expectations happened... His tail grew and headed towards the Rabbit and expanded creating a large mouth. Looking at the mouth that was formed by his tail, Theo felt as if he were looking into an endless void and then without warning, it sucked the Rabbit, leaving nothing behind of the existence of the Rabbit.<br><br>Theo was suppressed by what had happened. It was then thrown to the back of his mind when his tail returned back to normal and in his mind he felt he had to make a choice, as if it was an instinct, saying that he had to choose between [Essence] or [System Points].<br><br>Thinking that essence might help increase his strength. He ended up choosing "Essence".<br><br>When he chooses Essence, Theo felt his strength grow a little. Even if it is was not a very large amount.<br><br>"W-Wow... I did not expect <Devour> to work like that!" Knowing that by choosing essence, it would increase his strength, it left Theo very happy because it meant he now had a way to strengthen himself.<br><br>And what made Theo happy was that the moment he used <Devour> on the Rabbit, his strength spent while hunting the Rabbit recovered a little, so he still had a lot of disposition to hunt more Rabbits, and continue to strengthen himself.<br><br>When Theo caught Rabbit before, all the other Rabbits had stopped running, but when they realized that the Rabbit Theo had caught disappeared, they began to run desperately.<br><br>"Ah? Wait!!! Let me kill you!" He thought.<br><br>Theo then ran again with all his might towards the Rabbits. This time, because he was more used to his body, it did not take long to catch another Rabbit.<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>Attention, this romance has a bit of incest, Adrian's mother is not your real mother, she is your adoptive mother. Adrian has a relationship with her, so this romance has a bit of incest.<br><br>If you don't like it, I suggest you look for another novel to read, I put several warning labels on it, but there are still people who haven't seen it.<br><br>I don't want you to come and insult me in the comments about something I've noticed since the beginning of the novel.<br><br>the protagonist of this novel is male.<br><br>Hello, my name is Adrian Weismann. I'm 13 years old, I mean, I was 13, right now I'm going through my 14-year-old party.<br><br>"Why do you have a that serious face, Adrian? Smile, after all, it's your birthday." A woman said to me in a loving voice.<br><br>Looking in the direction of the woman, I said, "Mom, there's just me, you, and Aunt Nat here."<br><br>Seeing my mom's smile trembled a little, I quickly said, "Don't worry, I'm enjoying it!"<br><br>I said in false animation. Seeing my mother's loving smile returning again, I sighed internally. My mother is a very bipolar person, she gets angry, sad or even happy very easily, there was a day when I accidentally broke a vase that had a strange blue jewel inside, that day I knew hell, I absolutely don't want to make her angry.<br><br>My mom is a very beautiful person, she has a curvaceous body, long black hair and sapphire blue eyes like mine, I don't know how old she is, for some reason she didn't want to tell me her age, maybe it's a woman's thing, I don't know ... The only people I met in my life was Aunt Nat, a bald old man with an eye patch that by the way, he is very strange, he when he comes to visit me and my mother, he always appears out of nowhere like a ghost, maybe he's a weirdo? After all, he's always wearing an all-black coat, I wonder if he thinks it's cool? Maybe it's that eighth-grade illness that I read in the books? Something about dressing up as the character in a movie you like ... What was it again? Oh, it's Cosplay, maybe it's his hobby, well I'm not going to judge him by his taste, maybe he's a nice guy.<br><br>"Leona, the boy is afraid of you." A red-haired woman wearing jeans and a black shirt said with a mischievous smile on her face.<br><br>"It can't be! You love me right my son?"<br><br>"Y-Y-Yes, of course, I love you!" I quickly tell my mom that was looking at me with empty eyes.<br><br>Seriously! What is her problem? Since I was younger, she is like that, isn't she very bipolar?<br><br>"Moo ~! We have to start again! Adrian spoiled the moment! Sing with me, Nat! Happy birthday to you ~!"<br><br>My aunt looked at me with a face looking for help, but I quickly denied turning my head. I don't want to provoke my mother's anger over simple things.<br><br>My aunt soon started clapping while singing the song, following my mother's rhythm.<br><br>Anyway, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my life.<br><br>My name is Adrian Weismann, I am a normal child, who lived a normal life, my hobby is to be lazy and read books.<br><br>I live on a hill somewhere ...<br><br>Isn't that enough? I mean, which normal child lives somewhere unknown? I didn't even have contacts with other people than these three individuals that I mentioned earlier! Damn it! This situation is too strange!<br><br>In my first 10 years living with my mother and occasionally receiving visits from Aunt Nat, and that bald old man. I treated this as normal, after all, I was not aware of my situation, I am also not very intelligent, I am a normal person! I started to notice that my situation was strange when I ran away from home one day.<br><br>Since I was little, I always asked my mother to let me leave the house, but she always made an excuse and denied it.<br><br>Because of that, I ran away, and what did I find? Nothing...! Just a lot of trees!<br><br>Where the hell am, I living?!<br><br>From that day on, I started to suspect my mother and Aunt Nat, are they using me for some kind of experiments? Am I the son of someone important? Etc.<br><br>I started to think about scenarios that I saw in novels and knowledge books, I even thought that my mother was not my mother, come on! She looked too young to be my mom!<br><br>After that day what did I do? Nothing ... I also ignored this detail about my life, I was too lazy to think about it, it's not like I have the power to change anything too.<br><br>Living around here was not bad either, I always read in novels that you have to work to live in society, or how society is a horrible place, etc.<br><br>Basically, all of this was very laborious! I just wanted to live in peace and act lazily!<br><br>But my dream was easily shattered when I turned 11.<br><br>"Adrian! From now on, you will train with me!"<br><br>Adrian, who was lying in a hammock in a lazy position, said the only thing that came to his mind: "Huh?"<br><br>"I don't want arguments!" Natasha took the boy who was confused as a sack of potatoes and headed out towards the mountains.<br><br>"But I didn't say anything!!" Adrian screamed.<br><br>Adrian looked towards his mother for help, but all he saw is his mother waving a hand at him saying, "Don't go too far."<br><br>"Traitor!" the boy screamed in despair; he absolutely did not want to do something like train.<br><br>On the hills somewhere near Adrian's house.<br><br>"Do you understand, Adrian? When you're a kid, be quick to make yourself popular with girls." Aunt Nat said to me.<br><br>And why do I want to be popular with girls? I didn't even left this mountain!<br><br>"Now run! Run until you get tired!" she ordered to me as if I am a soldier.<br><br>I absolutely didn't want to run! It will be tiring! Apparently, she saw that thought on my face when she threatened me with saying:<br><br>"You have no choice here, run now or ..."<br><br>I swallowed my saliva and ask with a little fear: "or?"<br><br>"I will tell your mother that you broke her favorite dish and that you had the courage to bury the evidence of your crime in the yard, I wonder if she will be irritated ..." she said smiling at me.<br><br>"How do you know that!? Are you a spy?" I screamed in terror.<br><br>Seeing her smile, I can easily deduce what she is: "You are a stalker, right? you put cameras in my house and spy on me!"<br><br>Aunt Nat almost fell on the ground listening to what I said, she looked at me with an irritated expression and said with a general tone: "Run now!"<br><br>"Y-Yes !!" So scary! What with that expression? I've never seen her so angry.<br><br>I started to run towards the forest, but realizing that I haven't asked where I should run to, I turn to Aunt Nat who was looking at me with a threatening look, I took a little breath to gain courage and asked.<br><br>Aunt Nat looked shocked at me, I think she realized she didn't say how far I should run, huh?<br><br>"Let's see ... Run to that giant rock and come back." She said pointing to a stone that was far away ... Very far away ...<br><br>"You are kidding, right?" I asked her in disbelief, but all she gave me is a threatening look.<br><br>With helplessness in my heart, I started to rush towards the giant stone.<br><br>I don't know how long it took me to go on that rock and get back to where Aunt Nat was waiting, but one thing I'm sure of, I'm getting tired! What do you expect!? There was no way for a sedentary person to run all this distance and not get tired! Damn it! If it weren't for the short breaks I took halfway, I'm sure I wouldn't be able to go back!<br><br>I stopped in front of Aunt Nat while trying to catch my breath, my chest hurts! My legs hurt! Damn it! What did I do to deserve this?! All I wanted to do was read a book while looking at the stars.<br><br>"Very well! Although you are resting halfway, but as this is your first time, I will forgive you for today"<br><br>How did she knew? Does she have any power of omniscience?<br><br>"It's time for the next lesson."<br><br>"Next?" there is more?! I do not want!<br><br>"Listen, Adrian. Being quick will only make you popular in elementary school! In elementary school. it's those who are good at fighting who have become popular!"<br><br>Why such a fixation with popularity!? Why the hell do I want to be popular with girls!?<br><br>Aunt Nat took the black jacket she was wearing and throws it on the floor, now she is wearing only a black T-shirt.<br><br>Why she did it? The outfit looked expensive ...

Attack me however you want!" she said to me while taking a fighter pose.<br><br>"Excuse me?" I said the only thing that came to my head. Did she go crazy?<br><br>"No excuses!" She said as she ran towards me.<br><br>"But I didn't say anything !!"<br><br>Ahh! I cried out in pain when I felt a kick in the belly. Damn it! I will not be serving as a punching bag for this crazy woman!<br><br>I tried to get up and attack, but she easily dodged all my attacks, I tried to use my feet, but it didn't work either.<br><br>Damn it! Is she a ninja!? In fact, what the hell was she!?<br><br>Ahh! I cried out in pain when she kicked me to the floor and kicked me in the face holding my hands.<br><br>I tried to get out of her immobilization, but it was useless.<br><br>"Do you understand, Adrian? You don't know the difference between 'strength' and 'violence', do you?" she said to me while loosening my arms a little.<br><br>"What is the difference!?" I screamed. Isn't it all the same!? I quickly ran away from her and grab a stone halfway and throw it at her, but she deflects it easily as if the stone was too slow.<br><br>Damn it! She's fast! Or am I slow!?<br><br>What? She disappeared!? Ah!! I cried out in pain when she appeared beside me and kicked me in the face.<br><br>I tried to get up and fight back, but she unbalanced me with her feet, when I tried to get up again, she used her knee to attack my belly.<br><br>"Used incorrectly ... Violence!"<br><br>Ugh!! I spit out blood when I felt pain in my stomach. It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! I never felt such pain in my life, damn it!<br><br>"You decide whether you're wrong or right! Not using your strength is also a show of strength! It all comes down to your 'intention'! Don't just use your strength, use your head. Use everything at your disposal!"<br><br>Use everything at my disposal, huh? That's crazy! She's hitting a child! I want my rights! Damn it! My belly hurts, I'm getting tired, this was the worst day of my life! What was that taste?<br><br>I spit a little to the side and saw something red. Blood!? I am bleeding! She is officially crazy! Wait...<br><br>I spit my blood out of my mouth on Nat's face<br><br>Apparently, she didn't expect this attack, I take advantage of the moment she let her guard down, and I attacked her face, but she turned away? How? Is that even possible!?<br><br>"Good move, boy. It looks like you have talent." She said as she approached me with her eyes closed.<br><br>"How is this possible!? You shouldn't be seeing anything now!" I screamed for explanations.<br><br>"Yes, I can't see anything, but I can feel your presence, and I can hear your breath just like that, I can deduce where you are located."<br><br>Hearing this nonsense, I looked at her as if she were a monster, really! This was beyond an ordinary human!<br><br>"Now, you will pay for smearing my face with blood." She said to me smiling 'gently' while wiping the blood off her face.<br><br>I started to shake with fear, I don't want to be beaten again ... I have to think of a way to get out of this without being beaten too much! Damn it! Where's my overprotective mom when I need her? Wait ... Mother? Right! I had this method from the beginning.<br><br>I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.<br><br>"Hmm? Giving up? I'm disappointed boy."<br><br>I ignored her provocation and shouted, "MOTHER!!"<br><br>My scream was so loud that it echoed everywhere we were.<br><br>"Hey, boy! This is unfair!" she complained to me.<br><br>"You said I should use everything at my disposal, right!?"<br><br>"Adriiiannn!!" Hearing my mother's cry from far away, I sighed in relief.<br><br>It looks like it will take time to arrive.<br><br>"UHAAA!" I screamed in alarm listening to a voice by my side. Looking in the direction of the voice, I saw my mother.<br><br>"Fast! How did you get here so fast!?" Are there any normal people in my life!?<br><br>"With the power of love!" she said smiling at me.<br><br>That doesn't explain anything! What the hell is love power!?<br><br>"Adrian ... who did this to you?" she asked me with a 'loving' smile.<br><br>I smile innocently and said, "It was Aunt Nat!"<br><br>My mom turned to Nat like a predator that has found its prey.<br><br>"Adrian, you traitor!" Aunt Nat yelled at me, but I don't care! I still feel my whole body hurting!<br><br>"Good luck Aunt Nat, I will remember you!"<br><br>I started walking towards my house, totally ignoring the screaming sounds that came from the direction I just came.<br>`,

		chapter: `Earth Alone<br><br>The time was April. The university newbie left the room as soon as the lecture ended before everyone else at 2:45. He did not want anyone to recognise him as not an outsider, though no one knew him as such hence he would not have been stopped anyways; he still resolutely walked on to the hill road outside of the plaza.<br><br>There, he felt the unexpected change for the first time.<br><br>‘No one’s around…’<br><br>There was a huge number of people in lectures that ended at 2:45 Sure, not all of them were like Yoo Il Han Il Han, an outsider returning home, yet the complete absence of people in the plaza as well as in the hill road was strange.<br><br>‘Carnival is not on today. Was there a school event?<br><br>Even so, there was no need to feel strange. Yoo Il Han Il Han exited all invited chat groups ever since he attended his university! It was not as if he left out of pressure, it was solely out of his choice!<br><br>Sensing sorrow out of vain, Yoo Il Han walked down the hill valiantly in spite of the dearth of people. He wanted to hitch a ride on a shuttle bus, but there were no vehicles to be seen.<br><br>Was there a military exercise in the university? Perhaps a school wide hide-and-seek? All kinds of thoughts came into his head but he dismissed them readily. For twenty-odd years he had never held hands with a girl, and the lack of other presences right now was nothing in comparison.<br><br>However, those musings dissipated as soon as he exited the school entrance.<br><br>‘What?’<br><br>There was no one.<br><br>‘What the hell!’<br><br>No one was around!<br><br>‘What’s going on. What’s going on!’<br><br>In panic, Yoo Il Han repeated the same phrase inanely as he ran around. No-one. To conjure up a crazy idea like a mass picnic was impossible. The situations were too alarming to escape reality.<br><br>No one. No human to be seen!<br><br>He looked through the windows of the convenience store he often visited. The meal on a table was emitting warm vapour, the chair was pulled slightly back as if someone was sitting on it moments before. Furthermore, spoons and chopsticks were erratically thrown aside, giving them a sense of their users abruptly disappearing out of thin air.<br><br>This oddity applied for all shops. Incidentally, how about parked cars? Moving cars that were in traffic had violently collided in such a way that they lost their drivers, with some on the verge of explosions due to leaking, ablaze gasoline.<br><br>‘Damn it’<br><br>His mind may have been in disarray, but Yoo Il Han identified the hazard and escaped to a vehicle-less street. The reverberation of explosions like the ones in films soon tickled his ears.<br><br>Wind carrying the hot air blew, and Yoo Il Han fled like he was drifting on the wind. Then he shed pointless tears.<br><br>His mind was puzzled back together at a bus station.<br><br>‘Let’s go home’<br><br>Maybe after he washed and ate his mother’s meals, maybe after he slept, things would be different.<br><br>Foolish ideas again sprouted the moment the crises were over. His fantasies were broken quickly this time though .The bus was simply not arriving.<br><br>‘What the fuck. What’s going on.’<br><br>Yoo Il Han prided himself over his mental fortitude. From primary to high school, he overcame everything by his own effort. As a result, he was attending a quite reputable university, and he was confident to do well on his own for a foreseeable future.<br><br>The chinese character ‘person’ is to symbolise two men relying on each other; he never needed such weak stuff. Yoo Il Han always believed that he was like an upright number ‘1’-someone could accomplish anything unassisted<br><br>But, this was too much to handle<br><br>‘Have I alone moved to a different world?<br><br>His situation was too out-worldly that he said something so stupid. Nothing was changing. The bus was not coming, his knees were swelling in pain due to reckless running. Growing sadder every minute, he noticed his tears falling onto the bare earth like bird-droppings.<br><br>‘Pathetic, crying over trivial matters as a university student. No, fuck it. If I don’t cry now, over what would I ever weep? Isolation during his primary school days has made me dismal before, now the entire district is avoiding me.’<br><br>Knowing crying wouldn’t change anything, Yoo Il Han came back to his senses swiftly. It was feverishly hot and tiring. Home was his priority.<br><br>‘Let’s walk’<br><br>Despite the knowledge that no one was there to hear him speak, he shouted in hope for someone to reveal oneself. Yoo Il Han embarked on an hour-and a half journey shrouded in an added layer of disappointment to the obvious result.<br><br>Of course, his mother wasn’t present. He tried to check the time, yet all clocks, including those in mobile phones and computers, were stopped. Dad wasn’t coming either, Yoo Il Han concluded following a couple of hours of waiting as he stared at the everlastingly blue sky.<br><br>The TV only showed static screens, the radio the same and the internet was not working. It was like humanity itself had vanished. Except himself, who was trapped in a stagnant time.<br><br>At least, water and gas pipes worked. He showered and cooked a package of instant noodles.<br><br>Slurp…Delicious<br><br>The taste deepened his sadness and more tears flowed down. He was drowzy now that he was full. I don’t care for the mass disappearance, and whether or not the night was arriving, I must sleep. Possibly, something may become different as I sleep. He laid on his bed in these complacent thoughts. At that moment…`,
