		chapter: `<p> Sitting on the side of the road, Samael doesn't know why he is in this world. Samael Duodere, is the only son of the Duodere family who is an ordinary family in the city of Wahingtong D.C! </p>

		<p> This is a world that is parallel to the earth in Samael's memory, but somehow this world is called Blue Star! even the land is a little bigger than the memory that is on the head of Samael! </p>
		
		<p> Memory? is he reincarnated? maybe!? Why aren't you sure? because his past memories are blurred! </p>
		
		<p> Although the history of this world is not that different from his previous life! </p>
		
		<p> But many characters and cultures are missing! </p>
		
		<p> "But this is a bit problematic ... what is this book? The Request Book? Why do I feel like you've always instigated me to open it for these 4 years?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael looks at the book in front of him while sitting in his classroom chair. </p>
		
		<p> Even though he is not a genius, Samael is still considered smart because he was able to enter Georgetown University which is arguably famous here! </p>
		
		<p> He's currently majoring in business here! </p>
		
		<p> "Ahh - !!! Just open it! even though I feel that my life will change if I open it!" </p>
		
		<p> A bright beam of light charged straight at Samael's body and his vision blurred instantly! </p>
		
		<p> "Yes, young man ... do you not like it here?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael turned his head to see a handsome figure with white hair flowing down his shoulders and back straight. Sharp eyebrows and perfect lips as if he were a character out of the world! </p>
		
		<p> Samael stroked his temple and said, "Don't say that you are a god who will change my future?" </p>
		
		<p> "Yes and No!" answer that person. </p>
		
		<p> Samael sighed and immediately sat down in this pure white world, "The Book of Requests, is it yours?" </p>
		
		<p> The man also sat down and said, "Yes! it's mine. The reason is in your hands, obviously ... I threw it away. I needed entertainment, and it happened that the book fell on your head. No, you're lucky ..." </ p>
		
		<p> Samael sighed again, "First past life memories and reincarnation, then god things like you. You know, I'm quite satisfied with my current life ..." </p>
		
		<p> "I know, but ... you as a human must have ambition, right?" </p>
		
		<p> "I can't deny it ..." Samael propped his hands back and continued looking up, "The Blue Star world, although its history, knowledge, and famous people are mostly the same ... there is something different from the Earth World, Polygamy. . "</p>
		
		<p> The man laughed outright, "Hahaha-! Do you want to become the Emperor with 72 Concubines ?!" </p>
		
		<p> "Hahaha, don't forget ... I'm still young. So God, you won't regret choosing me right? Don't say you'll get bored halfway and pull everything I got later ?!" </p>
		
		<p> "Tsk! You think I, this great and handsome God will do that? If I get tired of you, I just have to find other humans in thousands of other worlds and make them my entertainment!" </p>
		
		<p> "Ahh, you're mean. But I can't blame you." Samael then looked seriously at the person, "So, what is the function of this book?" </p>
		
		<p> The man shrugged his shoulders, "I thought you already knew ... yes, it's called the Request Book, obviously all requests will be granted by him! Unfortunately there is only one request every one year! Isn't that fair?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed bitterly, "For us humans, even if ten years of one wish, we will be greedy fighting over this book. Don't say anymore, the world might be destroyed!" </p>
		
		<p> The person was stunned and patted his thigh and laughed loudly, "I like you brat! well, write your wish first. It's not that I'm good or anything, you've been keeping this book for 4 years. Really, I don't know why you didn't open it for that? "</p>
		
		<p> "I told you, I'm satisfied with this life. But ... you should already know my current state as a god." </p>
		
		<p> "Ahh, I'm so sorry for your father who passed away the day before. You were the only male in the family, one mother and three younger sisters ... I wouldn't say you were noble because of strong affection for your family, but that's human nature. "</p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed bitterly and shrugged helplessly, Samael's father Luric Duodere unfortunately passed away at the age of 47 leaving Samael, his mother, and 3 sisters at the age of 21 years old Samael! </p>
		
		<p> Samael's mother is Helina Viollen, 37 years old! </p>
		
		<p> Still young and virtuous, beautiful, seductive, and very caring for her family! </p>
		
		<p> It could be said that Samael's father was fierce towards his mother, just imagine, Samael is 21 years old, doesn't that mean Samael's mother gave birth at 16 ?! Oh my God! why isn't he jailed! </p>
		
		<p> Samael's first daughter and younger sister named Tilina Duodere, aged 19 years old and just taking his college education! </p>

		<p> But don't underestimate it! she still works side by side as a model! She is very beautiful after all. </p>
		
		<p> The second daughter is Ririca Duodere, 16 years old. Still in high school and loves hanging out with his friends! But he's made money too! by becoming a little Streamer! </p>
		
		<p> Then the third daughter, Finri Duodere, is still 5 years old and is the darling of the family! </p>
		
		<p> Samael touched the Request Book beside him and immediately opened it, only pure white paper was printed there, even though the book is about 800 pages thick! </p>
		
		<p> "Yes, there you are. Write, write your wish and let you cheer me on!" </p>
		
		<p> "Shut up, I'm concentrating!" </p>
		
		<p> << 1. Luck is unlimited !!! </p>
		
		<p> 2. Applications like in the novel World of Entertainment Star Circle that make close friendships with stars in the world! >> </p>
		
		<p> "Oh? World of Entertainment Star Circle, nice step to get rich. With strong friendships with other rich or influential people, you can keep the green light in your business. But only the boundaries in the world of Blue Star and Earth are friends who you can. Although there are some surprises for you later. "</p>
		
		<p> "Plus unlimited luck, if you go to a casino in Las Vegas, you get rich right away! Although I don't know why you didn't write down your third and fourth wishes." </p>
		
		<p> Samael chuckled, "Yes, this is the best move I can think of. The world of Blue Star is not too dangerous, so let me cheat like this ... for my family. For the third and fourth wishes, let me think about it later, make it. in case. "</p>
		
		<p> "Yeah, don't be too stiff. Now, in addition, let me help you save this book." </p>
		
		<p> The Book of Requests suddenly turned into a stream of light and shot straight through the back of Samael's right hand. There you immediately saw a black tattoo with the open book logo on it. </p>
		
		<p> "Then I'll send you back. Remember, cheer me up, well ... I'm also curious about your luck. Maybe when you come back a girl will come to you? Hehehe ...." </p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed too and his gaze turned blurry again. When his vision cleared, he saw that he was currently in the same seat, the difference was ... he was asleep! </p>
		
		<p> "Are you awake? Samael?" </p>
		
		<p> Samael looked sideways timidly and finally sighed, "Liu Yue, don't scare me. Right now it should be Mr. Polus's time teaching, he is very fierce! ... it's Mr. Polus' time right?" </ p>
		
		<p> The woman named Liu Yue covered her mouth and laughed gracefully, "If afraid, why are you sleeping right now? But you are very lucky! Mr. Police just arrived 4 minutes ago, Samael, you are safe!" </p>
		
		<p> Samael laughed awkwardly and he looked at Liu Yue's face. She is a foreign student from China and Samael has known her for 3 months ago. Even though Hot lost to the female figure in America, Lui Yue was still beautiful, her face and lips were rather thin, and her slender eyebrows flew towards her temples, revealing a pair of slender and sharp eyes. </p>
		
		<p> Liu Yue was a little embarrassed to see Samael staring at her face, but she still smiled and muttered: "is it satisfied?" </p>
		
		<p> "No way, if satisfied, can I kiss you?"</p>

		<p>Hello, this is my second original novel. I have written up to 5 novels three of which were dropped</p>
		
		<p>To be fair two of them were the same novel that had a slight difference. The first novel I wrote had way too many problems to count.</p>
		
		<p>The girl on the cover was not done by me nor do I own it either. I found it through google images and edited. If you are the owner please tell me if you'd like it taken down or be credited. The cover will change over time as I either learn digital art or pay some talented artist.</p>`,
		chapter: `<p>In a quaint little home situated in the busy city of New York was an average-looking young man who was quarrelling with an equally young woman.<br> <br> &quot;Don't call me unless it's for Rose and don't try to ruin my career&quot; Shouted the young blond woman<br> <br> &quot;Don't worry, I have no plans to get involved in your life. From this day forward you are no longer my wife, nor are you my child's mother&quot; Said the young brunette man with his fist clenched and his body shaking with pure anger<br> <br> &quot;I'm still Rose's mother&quot; Shouted the woman<br> <br> &quot;You're no mother!! A mother would care and love for their child. Sacrificing a limb if necessary but YOU, you picked the dirty corrupted entertainment industry. Leave now&quot; Said the young man<br> <br> (Note: Plz don't be offended I'm not saying women should be at home. I respect women, read a few lines further down and you'll understand)<br> <br> The Young Lady walked out of the house and left. Leaving only a shadow of memories that left the young man confused.<br> <br> *Sigh* 'How did it come to this. It's for the best. Hopefully, I would never have to see or hear from that bitch again' Thought the young man as he pulls out a small rectangular box from his chest pocket.<br> <br> Opening the small box he pulls out a white cylinder item that was placed between his lips.<br> <br> The item between his lips is a sweet that appears to look like chalk or could be mistaken as a cigarette from a distant.<br> <br> This was something quite the norm for him as this was his method of giving up his smoking habits.<br> <br> He had given up a lot for his family including Alcohol and work. He had given up work to be the rare stay at home dad.<br> <br> The women who just left was the breadwinner of the family, her name was Bethany Hunt now Bethany Jones, after the divorce, it changed back to her family name.<br> <br> The young man who was left to pick up the pieces of his life and his daughter's life is Theodore Hunt.<br> <br> 23 years old unemployed father with average scores and standard C.V. A typical dad bod with a very ordinary face and black crew cut hairstyle not counting his grey eyes.<br> <br> Though he appears ordinary in actuality, he is far from it, he has secret that he has kept since two years ago.<br> <br> Two years ago on the night of his daughters birth, Theodore Hunt died.<br> <br> The cause of death was embarrassingly due to tripping over his untied shoelace and hitting his head at the hospital's receptions desk.<br> <br> That night another man from a similar world took over the dead body of Theodore Hunt.<br> <br> David Johnson was the man that took control over the body. He's a simple white-collar worker that spent most of his free time on the internet or planning a way to make money quick. He abruptly died from an elevator malfunction.<br> <br> There was nothing at all special about him yet by some heavenly luck, he had the luxury to live once again.<br> <br> He was excited at first but he later discovers that he had nothing to bring to this new life of his. Apart from some odd quirks and some new shows to watch it was just another life to live.<br> <br> Although the world shares some similar things like the geography of the world and some historical events they have some very huge changes like the entertainment industry is not at all the same nor is the technology.<br> <br> The entertainment industry isn't bad but a feeling of emptiness is felt from anything he watches, listens to and plays.<br> <br> Technology in this world is leaps ahead with most things running on green energy.<br> <br> Even computers and Mobile phone are mostly made-up of a holographic image and have an incredible picture quality.<br> <br> Their step-in VR technology had already reached the level of being able to place the subconscious in a virtual world.<br> <br> After a lot of backlashes, the technology was banned for the high chance of death and now VR is done with the physical body.<br> <br> And the biggest difference is the presence of powers being considered the norm. It is recorded that powers have existed since the stone age.<br> <br> That does indeed mean powers were present in the world war and it also means that each country had its own historic &quot;Captain America&quot; legend.<br> <br> Even with the presence of superpowers, there is a small number of people that dress up and keep the streets safe.<br> <br> Although this world has superpowers it's normally just a meaningless power. 99.9% of the population will get a power that amounts to the same usefulness as the power Warm Hands.<br> <br> Which as the name entails is the ability to make your hands warm. Powers that have similar usefulness are called Minor-Powers<br> <br> The 0.1% would be the ones that hold powers that are considered a danger to society like telekinesis, super strength, super speed and so on.<br> <br> These types of powers are rightfully titled as Super-powers. Even with the title to differentiate none lethal and potentially lethal power holders only a few certain powers will cause many to be fearful and even be put on a watch list.<br> <br> Theodore Hunt is one of these Super-Power holders with the ability to create 3 identical clones of himself.<br> <br> His cloning ability makes him able to share senses with every clone. If a clone dies they disappear in the form of light particles.<br> <br> Clones do not have human personality but run on a set of instructions that are made by the original body. These instruction are very clear and simple like running, jumping and other simple stuff.<br> <br> This is due to the fact that his brain is unable to conjure up a false personality and is too weak to control three bodies at once.<br> <br> When you find out that you are under the Super-Power criteria you are then to attend a boot camp at 18 where you are taught to mix back into society but in truth, it is a year of military service.<br> <br> The military was keen to have a clone user, so they put him under surveillance before confirming that his personality had no faults.<br> <br> With that confirmation, multiple high ups around the base poured in trying to pull in the new asset into thier regiments.<br> <br> His ability we're immediately seen as making him the best scout and off the grid telecommunications.<br> <br> Theodore learnt everything from Gun Handling, Wilderness Survival, Boxing and Emergency First Aid and so on.<br> <br> He was the perfect soldier with talent like no other. So when it came to the end of one year of military service Theodore was to decide whether to stay or rejoin society.<br> <br> He decided to leave as he had his girlfriend waiting for him. Yes, the girl he left his promising career as a soldier was Bethany the very same women that just walked out on him.<br> <br> He doesn't regret it because what came out of the relationship was his beloved two-year-old daughter Rose Hunt.<br> <br> A short chubby baby girl that can already walk and say a few words.<br> <br> This was quite normal even in his past life but he couldn't help thinking that she was a natural-born genius.<br> <br> Before having the Baby, Bethany was working as a signed artist for a big entertainment company called Heat Entertainment.<br> <br> She at the time had a very a timid figure, average talent and didn't have any real appeal.<br> <br> After giving birth Bethany's body changed with her hips widening and her breast growing to a prominent D cup.<br> <br> After losing the weight she was a curvy goddess that had a mature air surrounding her.<br> <br> Her company immediately took up the opportunity and gave her a small roll in a comedy show in return she had to give up her identity as a mother and married woman.<br> <br> Theodore began to see that his wife was no longer helping in the money situation. All of it was going into her look to be a superstar. Theodore was forced to sell some of his family heirlooms.<br> <br> As time passed she was no longer coming home and just sending the bare minimum through a banking app.<br> <br> &quot;To think she gave us up so easily&quot; Said Theodore sadly<br> <br> He walked towards a bookshelf that was in the living room and pulled out two small cases. Inside were two platinum rings that had a diamond on top.<br> <br> &quot;I spent a fortune on you guys but in the end it meant nothing. Sigh, I need to sell these hopefully the money I get out of it will last a month or two. Now I have to figure out a way to make money from home. This would be easier if I had any memory of my past world. Why do I remember every detail yet whenever it came to any form of entertainment it's just a blur&quot; Said Theodore<br> <br> Walking up a set of stairs quietly he snuck up to a door that had stickers all over it. Slowly turning the knob he peeked into the darkroom.<br> <br> Slowly pushing the door open walked over to the drawn curtains and opened it to allow the morning light in.<br> <br> The light immediately attacked the little sleeping beauty that responded by pulling the blanket over her head.<br> <br> Theodore walked to the baby cot and said &quot;Rise and shine, Rose&quot;<br> <br> The figure bundled up in a blanket began to twist in discomfort.<br> <br> A muffled voice sounded from the blanket &quot;~hmmm NO!, Night Night!!~&quot;<br> <br> Theodore grinned and reached in and tugged the blanket down showing his tired daughter &quot;Come on, wake up&quot;<br> <br> Red blush on her chubby cheeks with her pearl white completion and her blond hair in disarray. Strawberry Blonde like her mother with unique grey eyes that came from Theodore.<br> <br> Adding to all of this was her grumpy little mouth that stuck out showing an angry pout.<br> <br> Rose responded with a cute little nose scrunch and a disapproving head shake. With her eyes squinting she replied &quot;I want Night Night&quot;<br> <br> &quot;That's too bad because It looks like a great day to play in the park but if you want night, night I guess we can't,&quot; Said Theodore exaggeratedly<br> <br> Her eyes opened up in anticipation as she kicked her blanket off and stood up quickly with her hands in the air, she spoke &quot;Up&quot;<br> <br> &quot;Haha,&quot; Theodore chuckled and scooped her up with his hands under her armpits.<br> <br> &quot;Phew, getting heavier by the day you are&quot; Said Theodore as his tickled her oversized tummy<br> <br> &quot;Hehehe, no Heehehe daddy stop it,&quot; Said Rose while wiggling in his arms<br> <br> &quot;Sniff, sniff, good job, no mess today,&quot; Said Theodore as he did his routine check on her nappy/diaper<br> <br> &quot;Yep no mess&quot; Said Rose with a happy smile<br> <br> Carrying her to the bathroom he helped her brush her baby teeth and washed her face. They then sat down on the table to have breakfast.<br> <br> Theodore was having a bowl of cereal and a glass orange juice. Rose was oatmeal that had honey and dried fruits with her sippy cup.<br> <br> &quot;Finish&quot; Said Rose as she pushed the bowl forward and wiped her mouth with her bib.<br> <br> &quot;Did it taste good&quot; Asked Theodore<br> <br> &quot;Really, tasty~,&quot; Said Rose happily while nodding rapidly<br> <br> &quot;That's good&quot; Said Theodore while patting her head<br> <br> &quot;Hehe watch, please&quot; Rose pleaded<br> <br> &quot;Okay remember don't sit so close to the T.V,&quot; Said Theodore as he got her off the high chair.<br> <br> Then went to the living room with Rose following closely behind. Rose sat down on the couch as Theodore put her cartoons on.<br> <br> &quot;Stay far away from the T.V okay&quot; Said, Theodore<br> <br> Rose looked back and said while nodding &quot;Far away&quot;<br> <br> Theodore sat next to her and pulled out a metal rod the size of a pen. Pulling the side a blue holographic image sprung up from the space in between.<br> <br> He found a few answers like the so-called online shop, a writer, artist and an online influencer.<br> <br> Online shopping needs investment and money, he has none of those things. A writer needs the creative ability to create a story worth reading, no use his imagination has been<br> <br> This leaves online influencer it's has a lot more freedom and could be easily done from home.<br> <br> Doing some basic research he found a popular streaming platform that went by the name of WideView. Then he found that they generously allow for newcomers to keep 100&#8453; of the donation they gain for the first two weeks.<br> <br> After that streamers would be only getting 40% until they manage to get partnered where it would then change to 50%.<br> <br> He quickly went through the sign up before coming to halt as he was asked to make a name.<br> <br> 'Hmmm, what should I go with. It has to be memorable, and unique yet still be easy to spell. . . name? name?. . . ' he thought long and hard before he noticed that his name was being filled in one letter after another.<br> <br> S_I_N_G_L_E_ _D_A_D<br> <br> (Note: The name is up for suggestions. I want it to related to dad)<br> <br> &quot;Wait, no what the F *Cough*,&quot; Said Theodore in a startled tone before looking towards Rose.<br> <br> Thankfully he stopped himself.<br> <br> &quot;But how? Is this a joke? Am I getting pranked by a hacker&quot; Said Theodore loudly<br> <br> &quot;Shush! me watching&quot; Said Rose with a grumpy pout and a finger over her lip<br> <br> &quot;Sorry, princess,&quot; Said Theodore apologetically<br> <br> &quot;It's okay&quot; Said Rose with a pure smile before looking back at the T.V<br> <br> 'Calm down, I can just go back' Thought Theodore<br> <br> &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; PROFILE CREATED &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull; &bull;<br> <br> &quot;NO!&quot; Said Theodore while spamming the back button to no avail<br> <br> 'Holly Fuck, everyone's gonna think I'm a creep. My name is literally an introduction to a dating site. . . . It's not too bad I mean it's definitely unique and memorable. . . who am I kidding this is bad' Thought, Theodore<br> <br> While in his moment of confusion and anger with himself and to whoever had messed with him a deafening noise sounded.<br> <br> *DING*<br> <br> At the sound of the noise, he instinctively blinked in shock. When he opened his eyes again he saw something floating in the corner of his vision.<br> <br> &quot;Huh??!!!&quot; Said Theodore in a confused and startled tone</p>`,

I am Maximus Spartan Prince, eldest son of the great King Leonidas I and descendant by bloodline of Hercules son of Zeus, the king of the gods.<br>		<br>		Now I find myself escaping from the Persians of the great battle of Thermopylae, my father sent me with 5 guards to escort my arrival to Sparta and continue the royal blood line but we were betrayed by Pausanias, my uncle who had agreements with the Persians and I would take advantage of the death of my father and me to be able to ascend to the government in Sparta since my younger brother Plistarco was too young to succeed the throne.<br>		<br>		After the rain of arrows ended, hundreds of so-called Persian immortals appeared dressed in black and wearing silver masks, the best soldiers of the Persian Empire.<br>		<br>		Prince retreat we will stop you<br>		<br>		A Spartan who seemed to be no more than 25 years old spoke to me, the guy was wearing a cuirass made of several layers of hardened and glued linen, reinforced with bronze plates that were quite resistant to blows. In the area of ​​the lower abdomen he had strips of the same material superimposed, to facilitate movement. He also wore a bronze Corinthian style helmet with a black crest and in his left hand he carried a wooden shield, concave and round covered with a thin layer of bronze to adorn it and to strengthen it, on the legs they wore bronze greaves that covered the leg. below the knee and in his right hand he had a 3 meter long spear with an iron tip and a counterweight, finally a 50 cm long Spartan sword that was used in emergencies. And a red cape on his back.<br>		<br>		I remember his name and it was Ezio, a Spartan noted for his intelligence and perseverance. Next to him were 4 more guys dressed in the same way, I was also dressed like that, only I had a red crest instead of the black one. . The tallest was Gregory who was cautious and vigilant, the most muscular was Leo a strong, brave and wild man, the slimmest and smallest who is actually short when compared to the others measuring 1.78 meters called Keelan and finally Tassos who had a scar on his eye he was very thoughtful and rational.<br>		<br>		Even if I want to leave, we are surrounded! I thought in my mind and I could only sigh for my bad luck, reborn into a prince I am supposed to relax since I would not have any problem, but now I am surrounded by hundreds of elite soldiers who want to my head.<br>		<br>		So knowing that he would die anyway I will try to make it as epic as possible so that my name is remembered in the history books.<br>		<br>		I threw myself towards the Persian immortals and as if my body knew what to do with my spear I pierced one, lifted his body and threw it towards the other immortals. The immortals began to counterattack, but they were very weak, I waved my spear making a horizontal cut opening the belly of five immortals who fell to the ground screaming in pain, my spear got caught in one of their bodies I tried to pull it out, but I felt that for me back a spear wanted to pierce me. I tried to raise my shield but an immortal was grabbing it, but before that spear reached me, the immortal collapsed to the ground with a spear that pierced his skull, It was Gregory who was a few meters from me, I wanted to thank him but it was not the moment, I left my spear on the ground and drew my sword and pierced through the mouth of the immortal who was following agpulling down my shield. I pulled the body away from him and continued advancing towards the immortals waving my sword cutting limbs, decapitating. My body seemed to have limitless energy.<br>		<br>		Meanwhile Gregory, who threw the spear to defend Maximus, cut with his sword, only beheading cleanly because he preferred to ensure the death of the enemy, he was the most elegant in battle, on the other hand, Leo with his spear pierced 4 immortals and threw them up. , with his shield he blocked the spears that came towards him. Tassos and Keelan also began to stab with their spears, and Ezio who was the smartest while killing immortals was looking for a way out for the prince, King Leonidas made him swear on his honor that he would take Maximus to Sparta.<br>		<br>		Everyone knows that for a Spartan death is not something he fears, what if it terrifies them is dying without honor. They long for the blood of their enemies, but they will always follow the orders of their King, which is why they were feared throughout Greece for their ferocity and obedience.<br>		<br>		An hour passed, but the immortals kept coming, but we were like lions surrounded by small dogs, although they were quite a few alone, they made us small wounds, I don't know how many times I waved my sword, but I already felt tired.<br>		<br>		Prince, the Persians are retreating<br>		<br>		Ezio pointed me forward, it was true the Persians were retreating but guys with mystical masks came, I think they are the Persian magicians. He was not afraid of them because according to the story they were only people who knew something about gunpowder.<br>		<br>		But I couldn't react to what they did, they took out a piece of paper and put it on the ground and everything under us started to glow and some kind of mysterious rune appeared.<br>		<br>		-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- -----<br>		<br>		Inform King Xerxes that the Spartan Prince Maximus was killed with the holy relic, but after its use it became useless.<br>		<br>		The messenger rushed out on his horse<br>		<br>		And to think that we had to use it, but it was necessary, we didn't have more time, King Xerxes was too angry, and he wanted revenge for the wound that the Spartan King made him.<br>		<br>		After this the Persians withdrew, leaving a field of corpses and in the middle of these an area with rare symbols that still glowed but slowly disappeared.<br>		<br>		-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ----------<br>		<br>		I feel dizzy and with a fairly strong headache, I opened my eyes with pain and saw the others getting up from the floor with difficulty.<br>		<br>		Prince, are you okay?<br>		<br>		Tassos seems to have been the first to recover.<br>		<br>		Well let's hope the others wake up more see what we do<br>		<br>		After ten minutes everyone was awake. We all quickly began to discuss where we are and finally we understood that we were in an unknown place.<br>		<br>		While we were planning what to do we heard a sound of a fight a few meters from where we were, it seemed to be the roar of a beast and some screams of some women.<br>		<br>		Prince, we get closer to see?<br>		<br>		In my mind I was still worried that we are on a desert island, imagine being adrift with five muscular guys, just thinking about it made my hair stand on end. But the sound of the fight gave me a slight hope so I accepted Ezio's suggestion.<br>		<br>		So we get ready, adjust our armor, and check that our weapons are in good shape. Leo had to leave his spear because it was already deformed, it seems that this guy needs a weapon that is resistant to demonstrate his full potential.<br>		<br>		We adjust our breathing and move in an orderly fashion toward the sound. I took the lead directing the formation.<br>		<br>		-------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ----<br>		<br>		In the trees was a beautiful woman who had pointed ears, golden hair to the waist, marking those dazzling and fascinating curves, on top of her she wore a golden diadem and strangely she was also protected by a silver armor. The face of this woman was very beautiful without any imperfection, her lips were red and soft, her slightly golden eyes gave off the youth of spring. Her bust was plump that would attract the eye of any man and cause several bleeds.<br>		<br>		Her beautiful crescent-shaped brows were furrowed which showed that she was quite concerned.

		originalDesc: '<p>A modern man reborn into World of Cultivation, reaching the top in his own unique way... (Alternative World, replacing original MC, Original powers, Grey MC, self-made Mc)</p>',
		chapter: `<p>(Most of the chapter is MC early life and it's mostly Summary)</p>

		<p>Surely reborn is a great thing, is it? Having that thought that this time it will be different! That you will do certain things differently! Like you wouldn't be shy as much as before! Or you will finally say those words to your dream girl!</p>
		
		<p>Yet for me, it was a different kind of second chance...</p>
		
		<p>First of all, I was not on Earth any more...</p>
		
		<p>How do I know? Well, the moon is too big, and the sky itself has multi-coloured Stars! , yes multi-coloured! and another thing is that people here are all Chinese looking, and building style is that of Ancient China, so when you put those things together and put that extra unique energy everyone is talking about...</p>
		
		<p>You will find out that...</p>
		
		<p>That I am in Cultivation world... should I be excited? Probably? After all, this world has badass Kung Fu moves, probably incredible beautiful women, Icy Queens, and some scheming ones as well... with a bunch of Young 'Always Boner' young master's running around...</p>
		
		<p>So, yes I am excited and terrified...</p>
		
		<p>Excited because there is a chance I can become something more, and terrified that I am born into a Farming household, where my parents know jack shit about cultivation, basics among basic, at least they showed me how to enter into the 'profound way'.</p>
		
		<p>A Very simple procedure, basically people born into this world have something called 'Profound veins', an extra set of veins which exist inside one's body, what I have to do is pull my 'Vital Energy' into these veins, once such thing is done, I will enter into the first Stage of Elementary Profound...</p>
		
		<p>This realm has 10 stages, and once I am stage 10 elementary profound I will be able to break through to Nascent Profound which is considered the first step towards 'Profound way'...</p>
		
		<p>A very cliché if I say so, but unlike my parents and brothers and sister of this world I did something else, alongside simply just sitting in Lotus position and pulling my vital energy into my Profound Veins...</p>
		
		<p>As they mentioned, what is 'Vital Energy'? Well In layman terms its Stamina in 'physical form' or 'Liquid form' I am not a scientist or medic, but that's the only thing I can think off, such thing never existed in my world, But I know one thing to improve one's stamina, and that is Physical training, there is no gym here, but as ex-employee of Gym and SPA, and having friends with P.T and therapists I learned few things how to train and upkeep one's body...</p>
		
		<p>So at the tender age of 8, I started training... and it was time when I learned that I was blessed, like any other Main character of Wuxia or is this world Xianxia? Gods who cares... I got cheats! In terms of very 'crude' system or power depends on view really...</p>
		
		<p>What it does is very simple yet considerate OP as well thing, what I need to do for it to work, is a herb or wood, or metal, then I can access its structure learn its secrets, abilities, or powers, and then I can pull it out, and add it into a thing of my choice, a very broken and powerful ability... what I do not know yet is, is it only for items or can I do it with cultivation related things like techniques ?, since I am reborn into one such world...</p>
		
		<p>But, Of course, I didn't have a chance to test much with it apart of working in Herb field where I was creating a Vitality herb, that's right! I haven't yet broken through to Elementary Profound as I was building up my vitality with exercises, something similar to special diet as well, Funny enough in this world concept of Physical exercise is unheard off...</p>
		
		<p>And so by the time I was 10, I started cultivating, with no modern-day activities or entertainment it was quite easy to fall into such routine, I even started to enjoy meditation and exercises, the concept of this Profound energy intrigued me, is it similar to KI from Dragon Ball? Or is it leaning towards magic?</p>
		
		<p>And so less then Two months Later I had a breakthrough, the feeling was incredible, someone like me from modern who never imagined such power instead relied on technology to do things, was an eye-opener, I can understand how this much power can easily get into one's head, especially into spoiled teenagers heads!</p>
		
		<p>After this breakthrough, I continued to cultivate, and train my body, with my system which I can considerate a mix of gaming like alchemy and crafting I was able to understand more about my Profound Veins, as for next levels of cultivation I will need to absorb Profound energy from Air into my Veins, the thing I found that there are around 54 entrances...</p>
		
		<p>How I found this? Well it's not too hard Since I spend a lot of time meditating and trying to understand Profound energy, one can stumble upon where the entrance is to one body, from there one I worked to understand this concept, how do I open them?, more importantly, how do I control it?</p>
		
		<p>So I started with Herbs I knew around my village, many of them have simple ones, and in the way a short reaction to one Profound energy, from paralysis to accelerating one's healing process, very basic and according to villages healer very common herbs</p>
		
		<p>No people of cultivators would care about such cheap stuff... but for me who can extract that effect and continuously combine to point where it can evolve into greater effect is a gold mine</p>
		
		<p>What I did is simple I made a few very basic pills with each herb, from healing to poison, and everything between, and then I started my hunt for herbs...</p>
		
		<p>By the time of my 12 birthday I finally did it!, no only I achieved Nascent Profound but, I unlocked all of my 54 entrances! The speed of Profound Energy channelling increased several-fold, and my speed of cultivation was increased to the stupendous amount, I knew what I did was incredible, and I will get a lot of attention, so next thing I focused on was creating A profound Art to manipulate Profound Entrances and conceal cultivation if needed</p>
		
		<p>And thanks God's or is it Heavens now? That I did!, as only a few months later did our Village had a visitors from local overlords the Sky Sword Sect, as the name indicates these 'Cultivators' are sword users and they use mostly Sword arts, the man leading this 'inspection' was a man in Spirit Profound Realm, and his minions were in True Profound, a realm after the one I am...</p>
		
		<p>After their arrival villagers started the usual ass-kissing, which led to my exposure, the villagers were far too happy to give me to this Sect for extra resources from them, it was the day I experience this worlds ugliness for the first time, they didn't ask me, neither they cared what I think, and my 'parents'? Well, they even added my sister to mix, fewer mouths to feed...</p>
		
		<p>They didn't even care how dodgy this Sect's reputation is, even we here in this God's forgotten village, know how they treat people who are not of the ruling family...</p>
		
		<p>For someone who was born into a free world, and someone who always had independence from the moment I finished high school, It rubbed me the wrong way...</p>
		
		<p>I already started plotting these people demise, this Sect, and this double-faced Village, They will know not to mess with my independence...</p>
		
		<p>The journey, to this Sect, was short, the compound was just like I expected was a city on its own with hundreds of pavilions, and Hundred thousands if not millions of people living in this place, it's like nothing I have seen before, yes I did live in one of biggest cities in the world before rebirth, but this? It's only a Sect which is considerate average at best... with their Elders being in Earth Profound, and their Master an Early Sky Profound Expert, which basically a realm where one can fly... with their own power, which is incredible motivation actually to reach for me.</p>
		
		<p>Once I arrived there, I was taken to 'proper' Earth Profound expert who inspected me, he was very impressed and instantly took me under his wing, the man instantly said that I have potential to be Elder, as the sect is actually family-based, so I will need to marry into the family and get name Jian added to my one, by the way, my name in this world is simply Feng, that's right simply Feng... to have a surname or house name people have to be quite rich in the first place...</p>
		
		<p>Not that I am planning to stay in this place for long, my master already had that weird Idea that I am already loyal to this Sect... that is the most humorous thing I have ever heard...he took me from my home, and force me to work for them, even look down, on me genius or not... since I am outsider, they even consider me like some livestock...</p>
		
		<p>For next two years, I abused the resources my master gave me, I even learned that he bragged to rest of Elders how he got a 'gem' from some peasant farm for his daughter, and how my sister is nothing like me, and how she is totally useless who will only reach True Profound in her whole life...</p>
		
		<p>That obviously rubbed me the wrong way, with all that nonsense going on she vanished from my life.</p>
		
		<p>The worst part, she WAS already a nothing more than a servant to one of the elders young Master, which is considerate high honour, that comment alone, have put a death marks on this filth, as this master is notorious how he treats his servants...</p>
		
		<p>It didn't take long for me to put things together, and learn her fate, that's why I hate this sect and what hold the main family has... even if I am genius I can't do jack sh1t!</p>
		
		<p>So instead I focused on my main objective, at age 14 my cultivation has reached fifth of True Profound, why so low you ask? Why the reason is easy, I am not showing off to these filths, instead and I am studying, gathering resources, creating a completely new branch of Profound Arts, which is included a proper cultivation method! Why? Because these morons don't have one! According to the Elder responsible for Profound Arts Library is that no one has such a thing! Because all you need is to absorb energy from the air, that was the man's explanation! which was utterly absurd, that's why I spend a lot of time thanks to my 'system' creating a new cultivation method.</p>
		
		<p>And that's right! I figured out my 'system' main point which word similarly like that Novel heavenly library something... only much more bastard version of it, taking bits, and pieces from art and putting together and creating a perfect one from all bits and pieces, something like some sort pillaging and reusing system...</p>
		
		<p>After all the preparation, I was finally ready for my grand plan, what I am about to do would probably earn a good amount of shoulder patting from someone like Darth Sidious, as I about to poison whole Sects top brass, and then to Perform a Profound Formation deployment in inner sect Grounds, which I was setting up for past months, and half, these bastards are so high on their Profound energy that they don't even realise that it's so easy to seal it or even take it away...</p>
		
		<p>People in this world are very, I mean very narrow-minded, everything in this society operates on Profound energy and its given power, and I will exploit that...</p>
		
		<p>Then Night came, I sprinkled the poison I prepared on Food, and drinks, people will consume, because of my status as one of the elders direct students, I was allowed to enter here, the Servant thought I personally overmatching this events food preparations...</p>
		
		<p>The funny thing with this poison is that it has nothing to do with Profound Energy, something which probably never existed in this world before, this poison targets motor control, and neurons in people bodies, turning them into prisoners in their own bodies, once that is done the formation will activate, and they will die...and their profound energies will converge in one point where I will create a very powerful pill for my cultivation...</p>
		
		<p>Then the time came I observed the proud and arrogant bunch of men older in their hundred years bragging about their students, talking shit about their rival sect, until...</p>
		
		<p>One by one they all dropped like flies, it didn't matter if it was Earth Profound or Sky Profound, in end they were still Humans, and humans still have to rely on their brains, the best thing is that I have figured out is, that which part of the brain is responsible for controlling one's Profound energy, and the answer was quite easy, its the part of the brain were senses are understood and commanded from, All I have to do is prepare Poison which concentrates on that part of the body, once it's done I focused making it invisible to Profound energy in one's body, after all its not attacking the energy it's attacking its neurons and motor control...</p>
		
		<p>I could stop myself from not laughing after seeing people which I genuine have harboured hatred at fall like flies...</p>
		
		<p>"HAHAHAHA" I walked over to place where my master was lying down, I kicked him into the side, so that he could lay on his back, I made myself stand in his field of vision</p>
		
		<p>I could see that he can still see me, I made sure that this poison doesn't take off one's vision or hearing, its a perfect Cultivator slayer poison</p>
		
		<p>"Do you know why I did this to you? Jian Chen? ..." I asked the old man who's eyes widened from disbelieve at seeing me, his prized Disciple responsible for this...</p>
		
		<p>"No you don't... because you are one pathetic man so focused on your Pride, which turned into arrogance, I hated that you took away my choices, I never was interested in this puny little sect, That's why I used your own sect resources to prepare this little experiment which top branch of Sky Sword Sect shall participate... " I showed him one feral smirk " And guess what? You have no choice in this matter...after all, I am giving same amount choices you gave to my family..." I laughed and walked away, I knew everyone heard me, after all, I made sure of this...</p>
		
		<p>Once outside formation radius I did few hand signs, and send a pulse of Profound energy into a formation which activated and combusted every single cultivator into a mist of Blood which was sent instantly into middle of formation which started to form into one very bloody pill, also known as thousand blood pill, a forbidden pill, which gives a very unstable instant increase in cultivation.</p>
		
		<p>Once the formation was done, I entered inside the pavilion where the event was held, there was not a single drop of blood anywhere or even sign of a person, the only thing left is bits and pieces of clothing, what I did I collected their storage rings, and left</p>
		
		<p>Since I knew guards should be arriving soon...</p>
		
		<p>That day I left the Sky Sword sect, with riches of this whole sect, with no elders or Sect Master it will disappear from the map in few weeks maybe months, but I finally got my revenge for myself, and my dear sister as her 'Young Master' is nothing more than a part of this pill...</p>
		
		<p>Thus now my real adventure begins...</p>
		
		<p>Funnily enough, I decided to take Jian as my family named...</p>
		
		<p>After all, if We follow Cultivation rules I am more then worthy such surname...</p>`,

		chapter: `<p>In a void, that is filled with darkness. In this place which is described as the embodiment of nothingness. Supposedly, there should be nothing that exists in this space, because everything that is swallowed by the void will instantly vanish into existence.</p>

		<p>This is what it should have been from the beginning. However, this all changed right this moment. In the space where nothing could exist. A humanoid white flickering light could be seen floating. Only a few could identify this humanoid light as a... soul.</p>
		
		<p>In this place that can literally vanish you into nothingness within an instant, this white light was as if the embodiment of light and life.</p>
		
		<p>The darkness that is caused by the void of nothingness, it was trying to vanquish the light. But, no matter how it came closer, it always stopped several meters away from the light. It was as if the void was terrified of getting closer.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Huh?... Where am I?...&quot; A voice sounded from the space of eternal darkness. This was the white light's voice or should I say the soul's voice.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I guess I got stabbed and died saving that girl. I think it's worth it though, dying while saving a beautiful girl. I lived my 20 years of life trying to be perfect. finally, I almost succeeded, but it the end I lost it all.</p>
		
		<p>I deserve this huh? When my parent died I didn't even shed a tear from my eyes or was I either depressed about it. The unbelievable thing is I was even happy when they died. The reason was because I was freed from their beliefs and teachings even though I know, it was for my own good.&quot; The soul sighed</p>
		
		<p>&quot;My family is considered to be rich, my parent's profession was a politician. They always taught me how to be exactly the same as them!. And I hated it as I didn't want to be bounded by rules while scheming others in a devious way to gain advancement by stepping others.</p>
		
		<p>Although there were good qualities about it. But, why can't I seem to remember? Anyway, I don't know why but in that place. Fighting and scheming each other is considered common.</p>
		
		<p>(Note: A politician is a person who is professionally involved in politics, especially as a holder of or a candidate for an elected office also acts in a manipulative and devious way to gain advancement.)</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Well enough of that I regret not following them. And also regret not treating them right because they are still my parents, but what's done is done. I can't do anything about it, they died and I died, that's final.</p>
		
		<p>Oh... right! Where am I? I see nothing but darkness all around me. Will I spend eternity here?.&quot; the soul wondered</p>
		
		<p>A light can be seen in the place that is filled with darkness, it's getting closer and closer to the soul.</p>
		
		<p>This was the second light that shined in the place of eternal darkness. Including the soul that is covered by white light.</p>
		
		<p>The speeding white light's voice suddenly spoke</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Human this is the reincarnation cycle, it is where the soul that has good karma reincarnate from,&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Good karma? Haha, laughable you don't even know of who I am. Yet, you dare say something like that? I was pretty bad in my whole life, being happy that my parents died. Trying to become the perfect someone, to cover the guilt in my heart. Even though what's inside of my personality is as bad as fuck.&quot; the soul laughed</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Indeed your personality was indeed not good, but that doesn't change the fact that you save someone in exchange for your life, and by doing that overwrote your whole bad deeds. In the reincarnation cycle, what matters is what the person did in his/her last moment.&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Overwrote huh? Does that mean I was forgiven just like that? Really-really laughable I was suffering for almost half of my life, filled with regret, blaming myself on how I didn't treat them right! Now, I was forgiven this easy? What was my life even meant to?... worthless!.&quot;</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Worthless? I think your wrong about that human, did you know by pretending to be your so-called perfect self save others, Let's give an example, the guy a whole year lower than you, he didn't have confidence but when he saw and talk with you. he felt warm and gain confidence because you were rooting for him.&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
		
		<p>&quot;S-Senpai do you think I'm a loser?. I always hide when someone talks to me, as I felt like they will hate me because of what I look like&quot;</p>
		
		<p>(He looks like a boy with nerdy glasses and bangs that is always alone)</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Hahahaha don't worry about that. Hmmm... how about we go out and cut your hair, don't always hide behind that hair of yours, that is why people avoid you because they feel that gloomy aura of yours...&quot;</p>
		
		<p>After that, they went to a barbershop together to cut his hair and in a couple of days his aura began to change, he made lots of friends.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Guys, that's my Senpai his the one who always helps and talks to me before...&quot; the boy said when he saw his senpai.</p>
		
		<p>Senpaiiii!!!&quot; the boy run energetically...</p>
		
		<p>--------------------------------------------------------</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Did that really happen? Well, it would be good if it did.&quot;</p>
		
		<p>The soul couldn't help but feel warm when he remembered the boy(Not really remembering, more like picturing it) and when he thinks he had saved him, he couldn't help but feel warm again, thinking that the boy is happy right now. He thought that maybe he wasn't worthless after all even though it is just only one life</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Human it is not only one life you have saved; you saved many lives, that you just didn't know; like the poor guy in the street, you gave money to, he is living, right! because of the measly money you gave him. That man felt pity for himself because he asked money for you and that gave him the motivation to work and earn money&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;You can read my mind?..&quot; He couldn't help but feel uncomfortable...</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Just don't mind that human. I assure you that I won't do anything to you.&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Let me remind you again if you forgot the only biggest one you save was the girl after you died. Stalling the murderer, the police arrived on time to help her, currently, she is praying for you to, Live in peace...&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Her huh?. Well, enough of my life I already felt good not being worthless, knowing all of this. So, what is going to happen to me now?&quot; the soul asked:</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Just like I said from the beginning, this is the reincarnation cycle so you will reincarnate, though more like will transmigrate; you will be living in another's body; you won't be a baby again so relax.&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Transmigration huh...?&quot; the soul asked himself not knowing what to do</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Yeah transmigration, just do what I said and transmigrate peacefully. The world you transmigrate in is interesting, that I assure you.</p>
		
		<p>Because in that world there exist, people call modern magic, you humans hope to be someone like a hero, sage, saint or being respected by the masses right?. In that world, you can be one...&quot; The light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;W-what w-wait I'm not going back to my world? and also magic?.&quot; The soul was shocked</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Yeah, you won't be going back to your original world, because you can't go to the future, there in your world. Only the past and if you go back to the past, it will cause a butterfly effect. And about magic, it is where you can do supernatural things like having massive strength, speed like the speed of sound and flying, etc...&quot; The light said explaining everything to the soul</p>
		
		<p>(Note: Butterfly effect means doing small things that make the change bigger... for examples if our MC goes back to the past and do things differently it will make the future change)</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Butterfly effect huh? that's not what I have to think right now... I have to think about magic. Magic huh?, it seems like my unreachable dreams are emerging, I always wanted to be strong that nobody can stand in my way. I guess this is a chance, but I feel like I don't deserve a second chance though.&quot; the soul said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Just don't think about that and believe in yourself human, you are human that was given a chance to reincarnate, so don't waste this chance and just take it.&quot; The light advised</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Oh...okay...fine and thanks, I will just forget about the bad things. I will live my life and fulfill unreachable dreams...&quot; The soul said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;That is the spirit human, don't bind yourself about the past and just continue and move forward to a better future. but, don't forget about the past because that is where you learn your mistake and prevent from doing it again.&quot; The light encourages the soul</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Thanks, I feel better now and learned somethings.&quot; The soul was feeling a bit better.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Now that you have decided, I will transmigrate you now, in your new world!!!,&quot; the light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;W-wait, w-wait a minute!!! Do you have any things for me to survive in that world?. What if I don't have magic or an affinity for it? I will suffer again, can you at least give some advice or things for me to survive in that magic world.</p>
		
		<p>As I am right now, I am pretty sure that I will just suffer, surely there are many ruthless people there. And maybe, having no magic will be discriminated on&quot; The soul said in a rush.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Haha, don't be so anxious, human I didn't forget about that I just forgot to explain about it...&quot; the light laughed heartily.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;DON'T LAUGH AT ME I AM SERIOUS HERE...&quot; The soul shouted in a very loud and angry voice.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;OK-OK... let's discuss the matter now, seriously...&quot; the light said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I was serious from the start...&quot; The soul mumbled in a very low voice</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I will give you the Unrivaled System, human... this is the best thing that I created when you maxed it out; you will even surpass me a GOD!!!&quot; the God said:</p>
		
		<p>&quot;You are a GOD?!!, I was very curious about this from the start and didn't have the right moment to ask, I know it's too late, but still, let me ask this. Who are you? Why are you being kind to me.? &quot; the soul said:</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Let me answer that, as you have heard before, I am God or should I say the one who ruled the gods and about being nice to you. Hmm... Well, I just think you deserve this, but most of it was just for fun...&quot;</p>
		
		<p>&quot;For Fun?..&quot; The soul didn't understand</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Well as you know there are more people who have done more good deeds than you. I just picked you because you were closer...this is my first time picking though, because minor gods are the one doing this job. You are just lucky, Hahaha.&quot; The God laughed</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I don't know what to think anymore...&quot; the soul said, being speechless.</p>
		
		<p>You mean all of this was because I was lucky? well, damn shit!!! I don't care anymore and just be done with this...</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Let's not talk about it anymore, just explain to me what that system is and after that just freaking transmigrate me.&quot; the soul said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;The system that you said or should I say the Unrivaled System, that I created is a System that can make anything/anyone be Unrivaled, it will guide you to be Unrivaled in this world, like me, I am unrivaled, right now. but still, I have the time to use this system because it was just made</p>
		
		<p>And you, you will use this system and be unrivaled in the whole universe. When you're at your peak, even I can't stand against you.&quot; The God said, he was full of praise about the system.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;If you give this to me wouldn't that be like raising a wolf. In the end, it will bite you...&quot; The soul said</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Haha, that is what I want, because being unrivaled in this universe. I've grown tired of it, that is why I'll make you my inheritor.&quot; The God said happily</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Why me though?.&quot; The soul asked</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Because you're lucky...&quot; The God said bluntly</p>
		
		<p>&quot;...&quot; The soul was stunned</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Enough talking, we don't have time, now. As I still have something to do. I will give you a drop of my blood, this will make you more stronger. Although it will be locked, for now, it will unlock by itself little by little as you grow stronger...&quot; The God said</p>
		
		<p>The god then gave the soul a drop of his blood and left with final words before he disappeared and everything was covered by light.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;The system will explain to you how it will be used and always remember this. The World is full of wonders, It also has the unknown and many possibilities that can happen, even the strongest can be the weakest in another place, so don't get too full of yourself. If you have great power, always be cautious, don't abuse your power too much because: &quot;With Great Power Comes With Great Responsibilities&quot;</p>
		
		<p>The Soul then vanished in white lights.</p>
		
		<p>The God mumbled in his breath.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Existing in my void? Yet, it was only a fragment of it. Truly, an anomaly. Maybe, he can gain and harness that power. Because even I...</p>`,

		chapter: `<p>When a thirteen-years-old Zuko was allowed entrance to a war council.</p>

		<p>He was instructed to be silent during the meeting, but eventually spoke out against a general's plan of action.</p>
		
		<p>In consequence, an Agni Kai was immediately demanded.</p>
		
		<p>It was actually the Fire Lord Ozai who was demanding the challenge.</p>
		
		<p>But when Ozai tried to burn his son's face, something unbelievable happened.</p>
		
		<p>He saw white and black flames emerging from the fists that were grabbing his wrist.</p>
		
		<p>And a completely different expression stared back at him.</p>
		
		<p>'Where am I?... I recognize this environment! He?! Oh!...'Someone murmured mentally.</p>
		
		<p>Feeling a very strong grip on his wrist slowly overpowering his arm's strength, Ozai instinctively backed off to free himself.</p>
		
		<p>His adversary complied by releasing him from his grasp.</p>
		
		<p>Baffled, Ozai couldn't say what shocked him the most.</p>
		
		<p>The agonizing pain in his carpus from being forcefully twisted, or the insufferable pain caused by the monochromatic blazes still burning his hand.</p>
		
		<p>Scarily, the white flames were leaving scars of frostbite in his flesh.</p>
		
		<p>But after a predatory grin and an audible snap of fingers from the young duelist, the scorching mini inferno extinguished itself.</p>
		
		<p>While Ozai was recovering himself from the ludicrous situation, he remembered who he was dealing with.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Am I supposed to be intimidated by this sudden act of courage?&quot; Asked the Fire Lord arrogantly.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;That is correct.&quot; Replied Zuko.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Do you consider yourself capable of opposing me, without being turned to cinders and ash?&quot; Asked the Lord, while ignoring his right hand protesting pain.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Who knows?&quot; Zuko said grinning but quickly shifted his attention to something he considered more worthy of his focus.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Such arrogance!&quot; Ozai retorted back.</p>
		
		<p>The prince ignored him without a care while conjuring the terrifying flames in his palm, doing what appeared to be, getting familiar with his newfound power.</p>
		
		<p>Ozai chose to ignore this disrespect and continued talking. &quot;But I'm impressed with your previous display, much better than that previous act of weakness and stupidity. Low your guard and submit, I look forward to seeing your future accomplishments.&quot;</p>
		
		<p>&quot;HaHaHaHaHa!&quot; Zuko wasn't able to avoid laughing out loud.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;You are just a fly pretending to be a God! I'm tired of you already. Bow down now! If not, you cannot blame me for taking your life.&quot;</p>
		
		<p>Ozai's face showed his tremendous rage at his firstborn's words.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;What's the matter? Where is all that confidence you showed when facing your own son in an Agni Kai? Do you really see yourself fit to lead our great nation?&quot; Zuko kept ridiculing his father.</p>
		
		<p>Ozai restrained himself from lashing out, and stated arrogantly. &quot;It's a shame really, I was expecting to see you finally surpassing your sister. But there is a limit to how much one can piss me off!&quot;</p>
		
		<p>&quot;When the weak rave this much, it's impressive actually.&quot; Zuko casually mocked him.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Tch! Di...&quot; The Fire Lord was interrupted mid rant, because of his son's unbelievable response.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I'm bored already! Should I be the one to finally end this?&quot; Announced the prince after stopping from playing with his fire, exposing his naked chest purposefully, daring him to attack.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;What's the meaning of this?&quot; Ozai points out his son's insane posture.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Know that I, prince Zuko of the new Fire Empire will show you no mercy.&quot; He declared, oozing determination for a brief moment right before relaxing again.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Now, attack me fully prepared to die!&quot; He dismissed him with a smug face.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Bastard!&quot; He shouted to his son, right before launching a web of lightning chirping so loudly that everyone watching the duel covered their ears in pain.</p>
		
		<p>But the prince just stood there with open arms, calmly closing his eyes while amidst the raging storm.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I'm not finished!&quot; Ozai started mid dash, just before engulfing Zuko in a sea of pure fire at point blank.</p>
		
		<p>Seeing the smoke of destruction made by his attack, he displayed a maniacal grin of satisfaction.</p>
		
		<p>When suddenly, the Fire Lord received a sweep kick that knocked him to the ground, hard.</p>
		
		<p>After the smoke cleared, everyone saw the little prince crouching while pinning the Fire Lord down.</p>
		
		<p>Zuko was chokeholding his father with one hand, and raising up his index and middle finger together on his other hand.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Cease to exist!&quot; Proclaimed the young prince.</p>
		
		<p>Ozai's face became one of shock and absolute terror when his son poked his chest with his previously raised fingers.</p>
		
		<p>A gigantic mass of golden lightning tore through the multiple layers of the ceiling and hit it's marked target in what appeared to be in one one thousandth of a second, blowing out the entire area of the ring while keeping the spectating crowd free from any harm.</p>
		
		<p>Except for some cases of permanent blindness for those dumb enough to keep looking at it when the entire building appeared to be collapsing.</p>
		
		<p>And like this, after the threat appeared to calm down, there in the middle of the obliterated area, getting up from the ground, was a very calm looking Zuko.</p>
		
		<p>With Ozai nowhere to be seen.</p>
		
		<p>Zuko's expression didn't match his trousers' condition, for they were torn and burned to the point of almost exposing his privacy.</p>
		
		<p>The prince stretched nonchalantly and remarked. &quot;It appears that this matter has been dealt with.&quot;</p>
		
		<p>He began walking without a care straight to the exit. Ignoring all the speechless spectators.</p>
		
		<p>Eventually passing by a very sad and conflicted ex-great general, whom he not even wasted a glimpse at.</p>
		
		<p>Azula's POV (11 years old)</p>
		
		<p>Azula tightly clenched her fists as her heart became filled with rage and doubt.</p>
		
		<p>She should have killed Zuko long ago!</p>
		
		<p>But could she really? Wasn't she mistaking his sudden display of power as if he somehow just acquired it?</p>
		
		<p>She can't imagine that he was able to grow to such a frightening degree in such a ridiculous short amount of time!</p>
		
		<p>It simply wasn't possible! Not for him!</p>
		
		<p>Could he somehow be the Avatar that her nation and family hunted for so long? Impossible!</p>
		
		<p>She remembered defeating him in all of their duels.</p>
		
		<p>'No! He must have been acting all along!'</p>
		
		<p>Azula's eyes widened just by considering the possibility.</p>
		
		<p>If she was right, it meant that this might be her first time seeing the real Zuko.</p>
		
		<p>Azula, however, was quietly watching his back leaving the arena.</p>
		
		<p>The fire princess was even contemplating if she should try her luck against him, sure all this destruction must have hindered his abilities somehow!</p>
		
		<p>But she wasn't a fool to risk it.</p>
		
		<p>Zuko seemed to be too calm, not taking any form of threat into consideration.</p>
		
		<p>He has easily surpassed their father in regards to power.</p>
		
		<p>She needs to start scheming on how to destroy him.</p>
		
		<p>And humiliate him, she can't forget about it.</p>
		
		<p>That's what her father always taught her.</p>
		
		<p>She knew, in order to become the next Fire Lord, Zuko would have to make the arrangements to his coronation soon.</p>
		
		<p>Otherwise, his title will simply be as the brutal kinslayer.</p>
		
		<p>But Azula's mind didn't provide her an immediate solution for the problems to come, Zuko's feat certainly will spread like the plague.</p>
		
		<p>Perhaps she can become Zuko's important right hand. That would help in her preparation to his eventual downfall.</p>
		
		<p>'Yes, I will not be inferior to him!' Assured the young princess.</p>
		
		<p>Future Phoenix Emperor POV</p>
		
		<p>After ordering the sages and royal guards to follow his instructions in preparation for his public coronation.</p>
		
		<p>The victorious prince went to his chamber to reflect about his current situation.</p>
		
		<p>'Such majestic power!' He contemplated holding out a black flare of flame amidst his fingers.</p>
		
		<p>Despite its small size, he could feel the air getting hotter by the second.</p>
		
		<p>And his room grew darker, as if all the light was being sucked by the small combustion.</p>
		
		<p>'The power of the sun in the palm of my hand!' As if to make his point clearer, the bottle of water close began to expel visible quantities of steam.</p>
		
		<p>'So... what should I do now?' He questioned while still observing the spectacle of science in front of him.</p>
		
		<p>He tried out the other type of flame he saw before.</p>
		
		<p>A more contained white version of his previous demonstration ignited.</p>
		
		<p>But it produced so much light, that he deduced it was capable of blinding someone else.</p>
		
		<p>Notably, this time his room appeared to become lifeless.</p>
		
		<p>The temperature was dropping just as fast as it rose before. The previous bottle cracked because of the sudden change in climate.</p>
		
		<p>'I know I didn't put enough thought in the &quot;melon lord&quot; matter, but the prick had it coming.'</p>
		
		<p>The prince stopped his bending and lied down on his bed.</p>
		
		<p>'But what about now?' He pondered.</p>
		
		<p>'Should I stop the ongoing war, saving innumerable lives from needles fighting?'</p>
		
		<p>His face suggested that some sort of good hearted feelings were emerging in him.</p>
		
		<p>But it quickly died down. 'Well, that is a more idealistic notion to it all I suppose...'</p>
		
		<p>Instead, a grin appeared on his face. 'No. The Fire Nation has the power!'</p>
		
		<p>'But was that premise wrong? Power is power. Power to do evil...or power to do good. Power in itself is not evil.'</p>
		
		<p>He himself was already OP enough compared to this universe's inhabitants.</p>
		
		<p>He didn't really care how or why he became this strong.</p>
		
		<p>He only cared about becoming stronger.</p>
		
		<p>Bending prowess can give him lots of things, but it isn't the only way of asserting dominance.</p>
		
		<p>It wasn't even perfect. Sure he had Hax-like bending abilities. But is it it's full extent?</p>
		
		<p>'I need to learn how to bend more effectively. If I just count with my enormous reserves of chi, it will be really boring.'</p>
		
		<p>'But, Firebending is indeed an interesting concept.' He acknowledged.</p>
		
		<p>'The proper way to fuel it is physically and emotionally, hinting that it is nature with the greatest potential for evolution of all the other elements.' He began his line of thought.</p>
		
		<p>Like any kid that paid attention to the cartoon series, he knew that there was an ancient art of bending that controlled energy in its purest form.</p>
		
		<p>'The ability to generate lightning was the prime example.' As he spoke a golden current of a billion volts of electricity began crawling around his forearm.</p>
		
		<p>'So how could it be controlled by Firebenders?' He questioned while straining the electrical fluxes enmeshed around his fingers.</p>
		
		<p>After clenching his fist, the golden discharge extinguishes itself.</p>
		
		<p>'Unless what Firebenders truly did was bend energy to form fire and lightning.'</p>
		
		<p>If that were true, who was to say what other forms of energy Firebenders could learn to control?</p>
		
		<p>No one knew how to do it nowadays, and no one really knew much about it, other than the fact that it had supposedly been more powerful than any of the four bending arts that existed today.</p>
		
		<p>All in the Fire Nation knew that it had once existed, but now it was much forgotten or greatly misunderstood.</p>
		
		<p>'I believe Firebending is the true incarnation of &quot;energy bending&quot;. Of all the four bending arts, only Firebending could truly create.'</p>
		
		<p>'Although, other elements may have other ways to control their substances, be it because of new substances within their element that could be manipulated. They could never create something of their own.'</p>
		
		<p>'Waterbenders needed a source to draw their water from. Earthbenders acted just the same. Even Airbenders needed actual air to control, regardless of how rare there might be of places where air was absent, my point still stands.'</p>
		
		<p>The prince smiled, thinking of the nomads that claimed to be detached from all mundane matters.</p>
		
		<p>'Only Firebenders could conjure their own element out of nowhere, our inner energy being a close next contender to my speculation.' He disputed.</p>
		
		<p>His mental ramblings made a lot of sense to him, he stared at the mirror and contemplated his new face for the first time.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;I can't believe I still haven't thought about my harem!&quot; Were his first words since entering his chamber.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Because of course I'm having a fucking harem! Quite literally I suppose.&quot; He joked to himself.</p>
		
		<p>But his stare then focused on something heinous in his reflection.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Argh! How stupid could have you been Zuko? Look at this ridiculous mixture between ponytail and shaved head! I need to fix it immediately.&quot; Doing an one-eighty to his previous smug face, Zuko furrowed his eyebrows and contemplated torturing whoever did his hair cut.</p>
		
		<p>He did not even consider that the original Zuko would've committed such a heinous crime.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Oh goodness... I completely forgot about the Avatar!&quot;</p>
		
		<p>He giggled at his remark.</p>
		
		<p>&quot;Did I? Why not just send an armada with those giant ships and raid the southern pole just before he is released from ice?... meh, it won't be interesting! The true war hasn't even begun!&quot;</p>
		
		<p>*Hey there! Thanks for reading my work! I hope this chapter is of your liking. I know the story didn't progress much. But while I was writing what I thought was gonna be a large chapter, I recognized that the transition between segments was rather jarring, so only this short chapter for now.</p>
		
		<p>As I previously mentioned in the description of this story. I'm taking a more relaxing approach, the MC is already OP, the only thing that rests for me to do is give my personal teaks to the original story.</p>
		
		<p>Any ideas for girls, powers and actions towards the war is more than welcomed. I might not use anything, but you will have my gratitude for trying.</p>
		
		<p>If this chapter is a mess of grammatical errors, please wait and I'll promptly try to fix it. But for that I need your feedback.</p>
		
		<p>I do recommend on FanFiction.Net &quot;To break the cycle&quot; from marinenerd01 and &quot;War for peace&quot; from Shadow0Fire. They show a more serious and realistic portrayal of the Avatar world. I really like them both!</p>
		
		<p>Thanks as always for your time, hope you have a fantastic day and please stay safe. Bye.</p>`,

		<p>The grinding works its way down from my brain to the top of my neck. What the hell is this?</p>
		
		<p>I contract the muscles of my body in discomfort and feel the blood rushing inside the veins and arteries of my body. It's a weird sensation, to say the least; feeling something active circulating inside the corners of your body having never been conscious of the feeling before. I, however, recognized the sensation because not a minute ago, I could not even feel anything.</p>
		
		<p>Ah, why are my thoughts so jumbled? It's as if there's a training running down through the nerves of my brain triggering anything in its path.</p>
		
		<p>I feel a creamy substance in my mouth. It's milky, icy, and melting down my throat. What the fuck is this?</p>
		
		<p>Holy shit.</p>
		
		<p>It's ice cream. Ah, yes, it's my favorite dessert. Oh, that feeling is comforting. Triggering a nerve and getting exactly the answer I needed without going through a jumble of thoughts. Yes, without having to think, I know this is ice cream.</p>
		
		<p>I feel something different this time. It's.. in my brain? No, wait, it's trickling into my nose. It's the smell of lavender. Lavender&#8230;. Lavender.</p>
		
		<p>What is lavender? Ladender&#8230;</p>
		
		<p>Lavenfer..</p>
		
		<p>What?</p>
		
		<p>Laven.</p>
		
		<p>Lavender.</p>
		
		<p>Why am I so confused? What's wrong with me? Where am I?</p>
		
		<p>Without having time to prepare, I feel pain. Pain.</p>
		
		<p>What is pain? My brain alerting me of danger, threat, or damage within my body. Yes. That is pain.</p>
		
		<p>I'm slowly beginning to recognize everything. I'm re-learning everything.</p>
		
		<p>Why am I re-learning everything? Did I lose my knowledge? How is it possible to learn something you already know about? It's as if my neurons are traveling high-speed scanning every single word I used to know.</p>
		
		<p>In time, the scanning feels as if it's slowing down. Now, my neurons have moved on to analyzing my memories.</p>
		
		<p>Instead of concepts, words, things, it's now thinking about feelings, thoughts, people, songs. The words I scanned are now being used to combine a huge circle that interconnects everything. Happiness, sadness, anger, rage. I feel all sorts of emotions, but the ones that affect me the most are love and&#8230; emptiness? Love, I feel a fuzzy feeling. Emptiness&#8230; sadness? Or is it depression? It makes me feel a pit in my stomach and a void in my heart. It feels so.. dark and.. lonely. I think of the word family and friends and a warm fuzzy feeling lights up my entire body from within. Ah yes, no more of the void.</p>
		
		<p>My thoughts slowly turn into one cohesive unit which consists of my conscious, and my unconscious.</p>
		
		<p>I reach into my deep memories using my consciousness, and my unconsciousness to assist with feelings and instinct.</p>
		
		<p>Okay, yes. What was I doing?</p>
		
		<p>I was at home alone, dragging my sixteen-year-old lazy ass into doing chores and homework. It looked like a groggy scene. The room was horribly messy, the windows were shut, the shades were down, and there was no light. My hair was covering my eyes and I was unable to see more.</p>
		
		<p>Okay, since I can't see, what did I feel? My unconsciousness helps me by giving me a feeling of void.</p>
		
		<p>Ah, I see. I wasn't a lazy ass, I was just sad and empty.</p>
		
		<p>My apologies, past self.</p>
		
		<p>I feel my consciousness reach into my ears. Ah, I can hear it now. It's rain.</p>
		
		<p>It's relaxing, to say the least.</p>
		
		<p>So I wasn't really that sad and empty of a person. I was just&#8230; is there a word for this? Oh, okay yes! I was in my feels.</p>
		
		<p>Why?</p>
		
		<p>Oh, okay. I saw my ex that broke up with me 11 months ago with a new boyfriend.</p>
		
		<p>And.. I was sad. That's illogical. I was sad when she broke up with me but I moved on two weeks after.</p>
		
		<p>Oh, wait, no, I didn't. That was my past self's lies to cover up his own heart. I did not move on.</p>
		
		<p>Without knowing, I looked for a rebound. Huh, that's pathetic.</p>
		
		<p>Why did I not just talk to her again and try to win her back?</p>
		
		<p>Oh? Because the relationship was in the dumps anyway? Mm, I do not understand.</p>
		
		<p>Ah, I misplaced the feelings I had for my ex to my rebound? Huh, the rebound wasn't even in a relationship with you.</p>
		
		<p>Oh, it was to distract myself from her?</p>
		
		<p>Thinking about them, I feel an intense urge to vomit, cry, and hole myself up forever in this darkness.</p>
		
		<p>Within my core, I feel a void quickly spreading and numbing my thoughts.</p>
		
		<p>There's a heavy cloud over everything. I can't think anymore.</p>
		
		<p>Why is everything so dark and depressing?</p>
		
		<p>I shoo the clouds away.</p>
		
		<p>If you were so sad, why didn't you shoo the clouds away?</p>
		
		<p>Oh, it's not that easy? I see.</p>
		
		<p>Why was I so sad anyways?</p>
		
		<p>Oh, within two months my girlfriend and rebound both left me in the dumps. I distanced myself from your friends because they didn't seem to care about my problems?</p>
		
		<p>It doesn't sound that bad. Oh, the sadness affected my school life, relationships, and my performance in anything that I used to be good at; thus spiraling down into darkness. Okay, I understand.</p>
		
		<p>Hmm, I started stereotyping every single female? Isn't that just a trauma? It doesn't seem too valid to develop a trauma though. Oh, I did it to shield myself from hurting that much ever again? Okay.</p>
		
		<p>I think I'm getting a hang of it now.</p>
		
		<p>I fast forward and now it seems like I'm walking on the streets. Stupid. Why are you walking outside if it's raining?</p>
		
		<p>It helps to clear thoughts?</p>
		
		<p>Huh, it would be cool if I could just know all of this without having to keep asking myself and awaiting a trigger from my neurons.</p>
		
		<p>So how did I move from this scene, into the pitch-black hole where I am currently?</p>
		
		<p>Awaiting a flash of memory, instead, what greets me is a horrifying sound that disrupts the calm atmosphere.</p>
		
		<p>[Ding!]</p>
		
		<p>ARGH WHAT THE-</p>
		
		<p>It's like a blind old man regaining his sight after decades of not seeing and being flash banged just moments after. That's how it feels like but with my ears. My hearing sense was overloaded.</p>
		
		<p>[Ding!]</p>
		
		<p>MOTHERF- STOP.</p>
		
		<p>[DING!]</p>
		
		<p>YOU NASTY SACK OF SH-</p>
		
		<p>[The system congratulates the host on winning the giveaway!]</p>
		
		<p>I WILL KILL YOU.</p>
		
		<p>WHAT STUPID GIVE AWAY? ARGH, STOP BEING SO LOUD.</p>
		
		<p>[Ding! Ding! Ding!]</p>
		
		<p>STOOOOOOOO-</p>
		
		<p>[Rejoice host! For out of the billions of candidates, only you were chosen as the sole owner of the Achievement System!]</p>
		
		<p>What stupid system? Why are you so loud?</p>
		
		<p>I could not help but be sore. I was calmly analyzing my memories and getting an understanding and now everything from myself was being overloaded. However, what put me more in turmoil is that my conscious and unconsciousness were both yelling, screaming, screeching, and crying that this was not logical at all.</p>
		
		<p>I feel overwhelmed.</p>`,

		chapter: `<p>Ye Sato, a poor guy living in the slum. Well, not anymore, his destiny is about to change.</p>

		<p>[The Touch Corpse System is activated!]</p>
		
		<p>Hearing an emotionless voice, Ye Sato woke up. The first thing he saw was a transparent screen.</p>
		
		<p>[Ability]: [Fightmanship: Lv3]</p>
		
		<p>[Function]: [Travel],&#8204; &#8204;[Touch]]</p>
		
		<p>He rubbed his eyes and thought he was still half asleep.</p>
		
		<p>How else could you explain this transparent screen in front of him and it looks very much like those fiction systems.</p>
		
		<p>Furthermore, it's not the first time he had dreamed of getting a system.</p>
		
		<p>After his mind cleared up, he checked if the transparent windows had disappeared.</p>
		
		<p>He sat straight up in the bed.</p>
		
		<p>Looking at the transparent window, in front of him, Sato was excited. His life can finally change!</p>
		
		<p>At the age of 13, his parents died because of the cold winter. Since then, he had been struggling to live in the slump. Barely surviving on leftover food he picked from the trash and the stuff he found in the dumpster.</p>
		
		<p>Yes, he lied about his past, but that's not his fault!</p>
		
		<p>Isn't it a norm to have a sad past?</p>
		
		<p>Well, at least he didn't lie about his parents.</p>
		
		<p>Never mind that, let's get back, to where we were.</p>
		
		<p>Breathlessly, he taped the status screen and when he touched the stat square [Power], information surged in his mind.</p>
		
		<p>[Power]: The strength of the body. The strength in the muscle.</p>
		
		<p>A very simple and clean explanation. He then taped the other stats square.</p>
		
		<p>[Defense]: The toughness of the body. The toughness of the skin, muscle, bone, etc.</p>
		
		<p>[Energy]: The endurance of the body. The sustainability of physical activity.</p>
		
		<p>[Sensory]: The information the body receives. The reaction speed, smell, sound, etc</p>
		
		<p>[Will]: The psychic strength. The mental capacity.</p>
		
		<p>[Power], [Defense], and [Energy] are common stats and very easy to acquire, while [Sensory] and [Will] are rare stats and very hard to acquire. There are also hidden stats, but those stats need hidden conditions to acquire.</p>
		
		<p>The average human stats is 10 points. Three of his stats are lower than an average human. The reason is not hard to guess. He is malnourished, but his [Sensory] exceeds more than twice an average human, and [Will] is more than triple times an average human! This should make up for his disadvantage, right?</p>
		
		<p>After grasping this information, he tapped on the rest of the squares.</p>
		
		<p>[Talent]: A genetic, innate, attained, endowed, or awakened power.</p>
		
		<p>[Ability]: A measure of knowledge. Once knowledge reaches a minimum point, an ability will manifest.</p>
		
		<p>[Fightmanship: Lv3]: Fighting experience.</p>
		
		<p>The level represents the mastery of an ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv1]: Beginner. Barely grasped the ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv2]: Elementary. Grasped the basics of the ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv3]: Intermediate. Grasped most of the ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv4]: Advance. Grasped the ability fluently.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv5]: Master. Mastered the ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Lv6]: Grandmaster. Exceed the ability.</p>
		
		<p>[Corpse Coin]: Dropped from the corpse. Can be used to unlock, activate, and use system functions.</p>
		
		<p>[Function]: The system function. Can unlock new functions with [Corpse Coin].</p>
		
		<p>[Travel]: Can travel to specific or random anime dimensions. Coordinate: [Ye Sato World] Cost:100.</p>
		
		<p>[Touch]: Touch the corpse to randomly acquire stats, [Talent], [Ability] or [Corpse Coin]. Inanimate corpses will automatically drop upon death. Cost:0.</p>
		
		<p>It cost 100 [Corpse Coin] to activate the function [Travel] and he had exactly 100. Without any hesitation, he thought about activating [Travel].</p>
		
		<p>[Possess only the current world's coordinate. Can't choose to travel to another anime dimension since there's no known coordinate.]</p>
		
		<p>[The system will generate a random coordinate.]</p>
		
		<p>[Generating a random coordinate.]</p>
		
		<p>[Coordinate [Highschool of the Dead] acquired!]</p>
		
		<p>[Do you choose to travel? [Yes] - [No].]</p>
		
		<p>[The travel choice will expire in 10 minutes if no choice is made.]</p>
		
		<p>He had seen this anime before and he had quite a big impression of it. This anime is nothing more than a fan service anime and for those who say there's a plot, he can only give them one answer: hehe.</p>
		
		<p>Ye Sato rumbled around his small cabin.</p>
		
		<p>He dressed in a tracksuit, to make it convenient to move, collected some clothes, drinks, and foods in a backpack. And since he's going to a zombie world, of course, he can't forget about weapons. The only weapons he has are some kitchen knives and a 7 kg metal staff.</p>
		
		<p>He left the knife and chose the 7 kg metal staff since it's more durable and has a longer range. Bringing those knives will only be a weight burden.</p>
		
		<p>He looked at the remaining time: 4 minutes left. Looking around for the last time, he had not forgotten anything and was ready to go.</p>
		
		<p>Without hesitation, he chanted [Yes] to travel in his mind.</p>
		
		<p>Highschool of the dead, here I come!</p>`,

		originalDesc: `<p>Hunted for possessing a heaven-defying object, Yun Che is a young man in both that life and the next. Throwing himself off a cliff to spite his pursuers, Yun Che is reincarnated as Xiao Che, a recently poisoned teen in another realm. Just as hated in this life as the previous one, Che must overcome his own hostile clan, his own inability to cultivate, and his own frosty fianc&eacute;e.</p>`,
		chapter: `<p>Yun Che&rsquo;s consciousness gradually awakened.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s going on&#8230; How is it that I have not died? I vividly remember that I jumped off Cloud's End Cliff, how can I still be alive! Somehow my body is not in pain&#8230; And I do not even feel the slightest discomfort? How is this happening?</p>
		
		<p>Yun Che suddenly opened his eyes and quickly sat up. He found himself in a comfortably soft bed, with a red banner hanging above him, rendering a festive atmosphere.</p>
		
		<p>&ldquo;Ah! Little Che! You&#8230; You woke up!&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>A girl&rsquo;s gasp of surprise was heard from his ear and the same girl appeared in his line of sight.</p>
		
		<p>At a glance the girl dressed in green looked to be fifteen to sixteen years of age. She was as fair as snow with charming rosy lips and a delicate nose. A touching look of deep surprise was expressed by eyes as clear and transparent as a pool of translucent spring water. Her face exuded a dazzling gentleness and softness. At this young age, she already exhibited such charm, so who can possibly imagine what sort of beauty she would be in the future?</p>
		
		<p>Staring at the nearby girl, Yun Che took a closer look and unconsciously let two words escape his lips, &ldquo;Little Aunt?&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>The fair girl lifted her jade-like hands onto Yun Che&rsquo;s forehead and relaxed soon after. With a joyful expression, she spoke, &ldquo;How delightful, your temperature is almost back to normal. You nearly scared me to death. Little Che, are you okay? Tell me if you feel uncomfortable anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>In the face of the girl&rsquo;s eyes that filled with deep concern, Yun Che woodenly shook his head. He stared openly into space with a vacant gaze.</p>
		
		<p>&ldquo;Rest here for a while, I&rsquo;ll go and tell your grandpa that you&rsquo;re awake. Today is your day! When you fainted, your grandfather almost went crazy and personally went to find Doctor Situ for you.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>The girl was in such a rush that she did not notice the abnormality of Yun Che&rsquo;s current state. She pushed Yun Che&rsquo;s shoulders, signaling him to lie back on the bed and hurriedly left.</p>
		
		<p>As the door shut Yun Che sat up on the bed, hands clutching his head.</p>
		
		<p>This was one of the cities in the far east located in one of the Seven Empires of the Profound Sky Continent&mdash;Floating Cloud City. And he was the only grandson of the fifth elder of the Xiao Clan&mdash;Xiao Che! He had just turned sixteen this year.</p>
		
		<p>That was his current identity.</p>
		
		<p>Suddenly, his memory overlapped with the Azure Cloud Continent&rsquo;s twenty or so years of memory and he burst into confusion.</p>
		
		<p>If I am Xiao Che&#8230; Then why do I have memories of the Azure Cloud Continent?</p>
		
		<p>Is it because I traveled to this body after I died in the Azure Cloud Continent?</p>
		
		<p>No! I am obviously Xiao Che! This entire room is familiar to me and I clearly remember all the events of my childhood. Everything from my memory was from personal experience and there is no way I would steal another&rsquo;s memory!</p>
		
		<p>Then was everything from the Azure Cloud Continent all just a dream? Was it only after I jumped off Cloud's End Cliff that I truly woke up?</p>
		
		<p>But the memories of living in Azure Cloud Continent were as clear as day. How could those twenty-four years of love and hatred be only just a dream!</p>
		
		<p>What the hell is going on?</p>
		
		<p>Yun Che&#8230; The current Xiao Che stilled for a long time as he slowly calmed down and settled his thoughts.</p>
		
		<p>It was still early in the morning and the sky had not fully brightened. Today was his and Xia Clan&rsquo;s big wedding day. Two hours ago he was woken up by his Little Aunt and put on his red wedding robe. He ate the porridge his Little Aunt personally made and lost all the strength in his body. He did not remember anything that happened after that.</p>
		
		<p>He did not wake up until now.</p>
		
		<p>A strange smell came from his lips and Xiao Che&rsquo;s lips tucked slightly. His expression darkened.</p>
		
		<p>This is&#8230; Murdering Heart Powder!!</p>
		
		<p>In those years that he lived on the Azure Cloud Continent, with the Sky Poison Pearl in his body, Yun Che learned about all the poisons present in the entire world and it could be said that there was no poison he was not familiar with. He could identify a poison&rsquo;s name and effect with just a whiff. At the same time, because the Sky Poison Pearl, he was impervious. He could not be hurt by any poison, no matter how toxic it was.</p>
		
		<p>Murdering Heart Powder was made by combining a unique soul grass and the purple striae from a cherry-apple tree. If dissolved in water, the poison was colorless and tasteless. A person would lose his life ten seconds after the poison entered the body and no one would know the cause of death for it was also a traceless poison.</p>
		
		<p>Xiao Che&rsquo;s eyes clouded over and instantly understood what had happened.</p>
		
		<p>In fact, he did not really faint. Instead, he drank the porridge containing the Murdering Heart Powder and was poisoned to death! He was born in the Azure Cloud Continent but after he leapt off Cloud's End Cliff&#8230;. he was actually reincarnated in this world inside a dead body!</p>
		
		<p>If one were to hear this, it would sound like it was a fantastical story, but that was the only reasoning Xiao Che could imagine!</p>
		
		<p>Wait a minute&#8230;. if it really was like that, then this body should have no antitoxin ability. How come he was safe from the Murdering Heart Powder on his lips when the previous body&rsquo;s owner died not too long ago?</p>
		
		<p>A slightly strange feeling came from the palm of his left hand. Xiao Che lifted his left hand and was surprised to find that there was a circular green imprint on his palm.</p>
		
		<p>This shape, this color, this size&#8230;. was clearly the same as the Sky Poison Pearl!</p>
		
		<p>Before jumping off Cloud's End Cliff, he had desperately swallowed the Sky Poison Pearl but he did not actually know what would happen to him. This mark on his hand was unexpectedly the Sky Poison Pearl and it actually crossed over with him to this world!</p>
		
		<p>As if in a trance, Xiao Che stared at the Sky Poison Pearl and subconsciously whispered. &ldquo;Sky Poison Pearl&#8230;.&rdquo;</p>
		
		<p>As his voice dropped off, the green mark on his palm suddenly released a green light. Immediately, a slight dizziness came over him and he unconsciously closed his eyes. When he opened them, his entire world was flooded in green.</p>
		
		<p>This world of green was wide and open. There were no boundaries to be seen and there was a faint aura of the Sky Poison Pearl throughout this space. After a long daze, Xiao Che understood, that he had entered the world inside the Sky Poison Pearl.</p>
		
		<p>Who would have thought that inside the Sky Poison Pearl, there would be such a wide and open world! What was even more unimaginable was that after he&rsquo;d eaten the Sky Poison Pearl without thinking of the consequences, the Sky Poison Pearl had actually traveled along with him, and even seemed to have become a part of his body.</p>
		
		<p>If there was a way in, there had to be a way out.</p>
		
		<p>Xiao Che closed his eyes, and concentrated his thoughts. Suddenly, the world of green hastily dissipated, and when he opened his eyes again, in his vision, was the room he was familiar with.</p>
		
		<p>Staring at the faint green mark in his palm, Xiao Che slowly smiled&#8230; Even though it was not known why this ridiculous event occurred, not only had he reincarnated, but also retained memories from both lives. Maybe, even the gods couldn&rsquo;t watch the suffering of the two lives, took pity, and gave him a chance to live again!</p>
		
		<p>Yun Che was the victim of persecution from Azure Cloud Continent&rsquo;s countless strongest individuals. Although he died in the end, he shook the world by himself; how awe-inspiring and astonishing was that! However, his body right now, was only average&#8230; no, speaking without restraints, it could be considered the epitome of weakness.</p>
		
		<p>In the Profound Sky Continent, profound strength was most important. Although Xiao Che was born in the Xiao Clan, and was even the grandchild of the strongest Fifth Elder Xiao Lie, his profound strength was still at at the first level of the Elementary Profound Realm even though he was already sixteen. He started training when he was seven and half, entered the first level of the Elementary Profound at the age of eight, and then didn&rsquo;t improve for an entire eight years. He was mocked by all of Xiao Clan. Afterwards, Xiao Lie invited Floating Cloud City&rsquo;s top class doctor Doctor Situ to examine his body, and shockingly found that Xiao Che was born with damaged profound veins. The damage was so severe that it was almost impossible to recover from. In this state, Xiao Che would stagnate at first level of the Elementary Profound Realm, and could never improve further no matter how hard he worked.</p>
		
		<p>Even if he trained with his life on the line, he would stay at first level of the Elementary Profound Realm his entire life. This kind of person was unquestionably the lowest existence in the Profound Sky Continent, and was a total laughingstock within the Xiao Clan. If not for his grandfather Xiao Lie being the strongest in Xiao Clan, who also could even be said to be the strongest in the Floating Cloud City, no one would bat an eye against him.</p>
		
		<p>Xiao Clan was one of the three major families that trained in the ways of the profound in Floating Cloud City and has limitless strong entities. In the large number of youths coming forth from the same generation, Xiao Che could be said to be an unnecessary existence. Even if he died some day, not many except a few would care. But there were some today that actually tried to murder him using the extremely hard to obtain and expensive Murdering Heart Powder. Xiao Che clearly knew the reason why now.</p>
		
		<p>Because today was the wedding day between him and Xia Qingyue.</p>
		
		<p>Xia Qingyue, being the same age as him, was also sixteen. However, at such a young age, her profound strength was stated to have reached the tenth level of the Elementary Profound Realm, almost breaking out of the elementary level and stepping into the Nascent Profound Realm. She was the only one in a hundred years that had reached this level of profound strength at the age of sixteen in the Xia Clan. There were even rumors that if she continued to develop this way, she would be the first person in the history of the Xia Clan to ever step into the Earth Profound Realm a few decades later&#8230; or may even be able to reach the Sky Profound Realm that no one in Floating Cloud City had even thought of reaching in the past few centuries!</p>
		
		<p>More importantly, she was not only shockingly astute, but also extremely beautiful, and was considered to be the most beautiful girl by all of Floating Cloud City. All of Floating Cloud City&rsquo;s youths with some level of competency drooled over her. If the Xia Clan started looking for grooms, the line waiting would probably be long enough to stretch between the south and north gates of Floating Cloud City.</p>
		
		<p>This pinnacle of a girl with both intelligence and beauty in the Floating Cloud City, was actually marrying the generation&rsquo;s most worthless youth with no future at all. Who knew how many people were stomping their feet in anger and jealousy&#8230; This was wholly a case of a dazzling lotus flower planted on a pile of manure that no one would even bother to look at.</p>
		
		<p>The ones that had unrequited love for Xia Qingyue of course held both extreme jealousy and hatred towards Xiao Che. Even more were unwilling to give up&#8230; and would try to assassinate him by poison. As the current Xiao Che thought about it, this situation didn&rsquo;t seem to be bizarre at all.</p>

		originalDesc: 'Theo volts, an 18-year-old Brazilian, died on his way home as he was struck by lightning. Upon waking he discovers that he was no longer human but a red fox. In addition, he also came to discover that he was gifted with a miraculous system.<br><br>Defeating monsters and frantic animals, Theo climbed into his cultivation, turned into a golden fox and conquered a Goblin village.',
		chapter: `<br><br>"Huh? Damn it started raining!" Theo exclaimed as he left the convenience store.<br><br>Not imagining that it would start raining when he left home, Theo ended up not bringing an umbrella with him. And the money he had, he ended up spending it, so even if he's in a Convenience Store he didn't have the money to buy a new umbrella.<br><br>"I'm not going to wait, I'm going home and running." With that thought in mind, Theo starts running toward his house.<br><br>But on the way to his house, he hears a loud thunder noise thunder coming from the sky.<br><br>"W... What? The... The lightning struck my head?". But before he even knew what exactly had happened, he began to lose the senses of his body, and his eyes grew heavy.<br><br>"Stop licking me and let me sleep! Ah? Who's licking me?"<br><br>Opening his eyes, Theo was surprised, because in front of him was a Fox looking at him. And what surprised him most was that above the head of Fox, there were some things written just like the MMORPG games he usually played.<br><br>[1st Tier of the Apprentice Kingdom]<br><br>"...?? Why are these things written on top of your head? Is this a dream?". He thought.<br><br>After trying to wake up, he gots frustrated because it did not work. He was still seeing the Red fox.<br><br>Wanting to have a greater understanding of what was happening, he tries to get up. But then he noticed that he has no more Human legs and arms. He then began to look at his body and eventually noticed that he had four paws and a yellowish red coat, much like the Red fox that was near him, looking at him with affection.<br><br>"I really died? Was it not a dream? So I reincarnated as an animal?" He began to wonder, remembering that he had been struck by lightning, and came to a halt in this situation.<br><br>"I became a Red fox?" He asked himself with doubts.<br><br>The moment the Red fox noticed that Theo was well, she left the Den and after a while, she came back with a Rabbit in her mouth.<br><br>The Red Fox then headed towards Theo and left the Rabbit on Theo's side.<br><br>"She wants me to eat the Rabbit?" He wondered, seeing the Rabbit that was left in front of him by the Red-fox.<br><br>He then noticed that he was very hungry, and he needed food! But he could not get used to the idea of ​​eating something raw...<br><br>Theo: "Now that I have become an animal, it is likely that I will only eat raw meat anyways. Now that things have come to this, I can only accept it." Seeing that things have come to this point and that his hunger was great, he has accepted his fate.<br><br>Theo approached the dead Rabbit on the ground. And he opened his mouth and began to nibble on the Rabbit. Even while feeling repulsed, he continued to eat. Since he was very hungry right now.<br><br>"Mm, after eating a little, I see it's not as bad as I imagined... this can only be because I'm not human anymore."<br><br>When he finished eating the whole Rabbit a transparent blue window appeared in front of him, very similar to the one on the head of the Red fox.<br><br>[Skill <Devour> Unlocked]<br><br>Devour: When using this ability, you can turn it into [Essence] or [System Point]<br><br>Theo: "What is this crazy thing? Where did this blue screen come from? Is that a gaming system screen?" He had already thought about it, but seeing it appear, he began to believe that it really looks like a game screen.<br><br>He then began to wonder whether if while dying and reincarnating as an animal, he ended up obtaining a game system. He was so excited about this that he began to think it wouldn't have been that bad to have died.<br><br>"Can I see my status?" He thought.<br><br>The moment he thought of status. A blue screen reappeared.<br><br>Cultivation: 1st Tier of the Apprentice Kingdom: Small Advance.<br><br><Devour> (Active) Maximum Level<br><br>"Hahaha! It really worked!" Theo was very happy, seeing the status bar that appeared. He didn't start jumping from joy at that moment because his body was still very weak and he was inside a narrow Den.<br><br>"I'm on the same layer of cultivation as the Red fox that brought me the Rabbit..." Theo thought after seeing his status.<br><br>"Ah?! I have an affinity with Lightning and Darkness? How do I use this?" Seeing that in his status it said that he possessed an affinity with Lightning and Darkness. Theo moved his left paw towards the bar, where it said his affinities. The moment he did this, another information bar came up.<br><br>[Affinities: Beings that are born with affinities can form a magic core in the 4th Layer of the Apprentice Kingdom]<br><br>"Oh! So that's something I can use when I get to the 4th Tier of the Apprentice Kingdom." Even though he was very curious about everything that's happened to him, Theo decided to sleep since he felt tired and sleepy, and after waking up again, he thinks about what to do.<br><br>"Haa~" While listening to the noise of nature and the birds singing, Theo woke up.<br><br>This time, when he woke up, Theo did not feel as weak as before. With a good night's sleep, he felt better. He then stands up, realizing that the Red fox was not in the Den and he decides to leave the Den too.<br><br>Leaving the Den, Theo noticed that he was surrounded by gigantic trees, there were also many plants and flowers. Walking through the forest slowly and cautiously and after going past many trees... Theo saw an open field and he saw that that field had many Rabbits.<br><br>Above the heads of the Rabbits, Theo noticed that they did not have the cultivation bar.<br><br>"They don't seem difficult to kill. Unlike when I looked at the Red fox, towards these rabbits, it doesn't say they have cultivation!" He thought.<br><br>Seeing that the Rabbits continue to nibble the bushes. Theo crouched in the bush and began to crawl towards 2 Rabbits that were not too far from him, getting close to the 2 Rabbits. About 4 to 5 meters away ... the Rabbits ended up noticing him and began to run for their lives.<br><br>Seeing this, Theo started running after 2 Rabbits. He was running awkwardly since he wasn't used to his current form.<br><br>"These Rabbits are fleeing too fast! And I'm not yet used to this body..." He thought.<br><br>After running for a long time behind the Rabbits, Theo began to get a little used to his current form and managed to reach one Rabbit. He ended up killing the Rabbit the moment he put his fangs on the neck of the Rabbit. And soon he began to feel a taste of the rabbit's blood in his mouth.<br><br>"It does not look like I get exp killing..." He thought, while sad.<br><br>"Ah! I had gained the ability to devour. I'll test it on this Rabbit." He then recalled that he had gained this ability while he was eating the Rabbit, which was given by the Red fox. So decided to test it on that Rabbits.<br><br>Saying "Devour" in his mind, Theo was able to use his ability.<br><br>Then, something far beyond his expectations happened... His tail grew and headed towards the Rabbit and expanded creating a large mouth. Looking at the mouth that was formed by his tail, Theo felt as if he were looking into an endless void and then without warning, it sucked the Rabbit, leaving nothing behind of the existence of the Rabbit.<br><br>Theo was suppressed by what had happened. It was then thrown to the back of his mind when his tail returned back to normal and in his mind he felt he had to make a choice, as if it was an instinct, saying that he had to choose between [Essence] or [System Points].<br><br>Thinking that essence might help increase his strength. He ended up choosing "Essence".<br><br>When he chooses Essence, Theo felt his strength grow a little. Even if it is was not a very large amount.<br><br>"W-Wow... I did not expect <Devour> to work like that!" Knowing that by choosing essence, it would increase his strength, it left Theo very happy because it meant he now had a way to strengthen himself.<br><br>And what made Theo happy was that the moment he used <Devour> on the Rabbit, his strength spent while hunting the Rabbit recovered a little, so he still had a lot of disposition to hunt more Rabbits, and continue to strengthen himself.<br><br>When Theo caught Rabbit before, all the other Rabbits had stopped running, but when they realized that the Rabbit Theo had caught disappeared, they began to run desperately.<br><br>"Ah? Wait!!! Let me kill you!" He thought.<br><br>Theo then ran again with all his might towards the Rabbits. This time, because he was more used to his body, it did not take long to catch another Rabbit.<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>Attention, this romance has a bit of incest, Adrian's mother is not your real mother, she is your adoptive mother. Adrian has a relationship with her, so this romance has a bit of incest.<br><br>If you don't like it, I suggest you look for another novel to read, I put several warning labels on it, but there are still people who haven't seen it.<br><br>I don't want you to come and insult me in the comments about something I've noticed since the beginning of the novel.<br><br>the protagonist of this novel is male.<br><br>Hello, my name is Adrian Weismann. I'm 13 years old, I mean, I was 13, right now I'm going through my 14-year-old party.<br><br>"Why do you have a that serious face, Adrian? Smile, after all, it's your birthday." A woman said to me in a loving voice.<br><br>Looking in the direction of the woman, I said, "Mom, there's just me, you, and Aunt Nat here."<br><br>Seeing my mom's smile trembled a little, I quickly said, "Don't worry, I'm enjoying it!"<br><br>I said in false animation. Seeing my mother's loving smile returning again, I sighed internally. My mother is a very bipolar person, she gets angry, sad or even happy very easily, there was a day when I accidentally broke a vase that had a strange blue jewel inside, that day I knew hell, I absolutely don't want to make her angry.<br><br>My mom is a very beautiful person, she has a curvaceous body, long black hair and sapphire blue eyes like mine, I don't know how old she is, for some reason she didn't want to tell me her age, maybe it's a woman's thing, I don't know ... The only people I met in my life was Aunt Nat, a bald old man with an eye patch that by the way, he is very strange, he when he comes to visit me and my mother, he always appears out of nowhere like a ghost, maybe he's a weirdo? After all, he's always wearing an all-black coat, I wonder if he thinks it's cool? Maybe it's that eighth-grade illness that I read in the books? Something about dressing up as the character in a movie you like ... What was it again? Oh, it's Cosplay, maybe it's his hobby, well I'm not going to judge him by his taste, maybe he's a nice guy.<br><br>"Leona, the boy is afraid of you." A red-haired woman wearing jeans and a black shirt said with a mischievous smile on her face.<br><br>"It can't be! You love me right my son?"<br><br>"Y-Y-Yes, of course, I love you!" I quickly tell my mom that was looking at me with empty eyes.<br><br>Seriously! What is her problem? Since I was younger, she is like that, isn't she very bipolar?<br><br>"Moo ~! We have to start again! Adrian spoiled the moment! Sing with me, Nat! Happy birthday to you ~!"<br><br>My aunt looked at me with a face looking for help, but I quickly denied turning my head. I don't want to provoke my mother's anger over simple things.<br><br>My aunt soon started clapping while singing the song, following my mother's rhythm.<br><br>Anyway, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my life.<br><br>My name is Adrian Weismann, I am a normal child, who lived a normal life, my hobby is to be lazy and read books.<br><br>I live on a hill somewhere ...<br><br>Isn't that enough? I mean, which normal child lives somewhere unknown? I didn't even have contacts with other people than these three individuals that I mentioned earlier! Damn it! This situation is too strange!<br><br>In my first 10 years living with my mother and occasionally receiving visits from Aunt Nat, and that bald old man. I treated this as normal, after all, I was not aware of my situation, I am also not very intelligent, I am a normal person! I started to notice that my situation was strange when I ran away from home one day.<br><br>Since I was little, I always asked my mother to let me leave the house, but she always made an excuse and denied it.<br><br>Because of that, I ran away, and what did I find? Nothing...! Just a lot of trees!<br><br>Where the hell am, I living?!<br><br>From that day on, I started to suspect my mother and Aunt Nat, are they using me for some kind of experiments? Am I the son of someone important? Etc.<br><br>I started to think about scenarios that I saw in novels and knowledge books, I even thought that my mother was not my mother, come on! She looked too young to be my mom!<br><br>After that day what did I do? Nothing ... I also ignored this detail about my life, I was too lazy to think about it, it's not like I have the power to change anything too.<br><br>Living around here was not bad either, I always read in novels that you have to work to live in society, or how society is a horrible place, etc.<br><br>Basically, all of this was very laborious! I just wanted to live in peace and act lazily!<br><br>But my dream was easily shattered when I turned 11.<br><br>"Adrian! From now on, you will train with me!"<br><br>Adrian, who was lying in a hammock in a lazy position, said the only thing that came to his mind: "Huh?"<br><br>"I don't want arguments!" Natasha took the boy who was confused as a sack of potatoes and headed out towards the mountains.<br><br>"But I didn't say anything!!" Adrian screamed.<br><br>Adrian looked towards his mother for help, but all he saw is his mother waving a hand at him saying, "Don't go too far."<br><br>"Traitor!" the boy screamed in despair; he absolutely did not want to do something like train.<br><br>On the hills somewhere near Adrian's house.<br><br>"Do you understand, Adrian? When you're a kid, be quick to make yourself popular with girls." Aunt Nat said to me.<br><br>And why do I want to be popular with girls? I didn't even left this mountain!<br><br>"Now run! Run until you get tired!" she ordered to me as if I am a soldier.<br><br>I absolutely didn't want to run! It will be tiring! Apparently, she saw that thought on my face when she threatened me with saying:<br><br>"You have no choice here, run now or ..."<br><br>I swallowed my saliva and ask with a little fear: "or?"<br><br>"I will tell your mother that you broke her favorite dish and that you had the courage to bury the evidence of your crime in the yard, I wonder if she will be irritated ..." she said smiling at me.<br><br>"How do you know that!? Are you a spy?" I screamed in terror.<br><br>Seeing her smile, I can easily deduce what she is: "You are a stalker, right? you put cameras in my house and spy on me!"<br><br>Aunt Nat almost fell on the ground listening to what I said, she looked at me with an irritated expression and said with a general tone: "Run now!"<br><br>"Y-Yes !!" So scary! What with that expression? I've never seen her so angry.<br><br>I started to run towards the forest, but realizing that I haven't asked where I should run to, I turn to Aunt Nat who was looking at me with a threatening look, I took a little breath to gain courage and asked.<br><br>Aunt Nat looked shocked at me, I think she realized she didn't say how far I should run, huh?<br><br>"Let's see ... Run to that giant rock and come back." She said pointing to a stone that was far away ... Very far away ...<br><br>"You are kidding, right?" I asked her in disbelief, but all she gave me is a threatening look.<br><br>With helplessness in my heart, I started to rush towards the giant stone.<br><br>I don't know how long it took me to go on that rock and get back to where Aunt Nat was waiting, but one thing I'm sure of, I'm getting tired! What do you expect!? There was no way for a sedentary person to run all this distance and not get tired! Damn it! If it weren't for the short breaks I took halfway, I'm sure I wouldn't be able to go back!<br><br>I stopped in front of Aunt Nat while trying to catch my breath, my chest hurts! My legs hurt! Damn it! What did I do to deserve this?! All I wanted to do was read a book while looking at the stars.<br><br>"Very well! Although you are resting halfway, but as this is your first time, I will forgive you for today"<br><br>How did she knew? Does she have any power of omniscience?<br><br>"It's time for the next lesson."<br><br>"Next?" there is more?! I do not want!<br><br>"Listen, Adrian. Being quick will only make you popular in elementary school! In elementary school. it's those who are good at fighting who have become popular!"<br><br>Why such a fixation with popularity!? Why the hell do I want to be popular with girls!?<br><br>Aunt Nat took the black jacket she was wearing and throws it on the floor, now she is wearing only a black T-shirt.<br><br>Why she did it? The outfit looked expensive ...<br><br>"It's all right! Attack me however you want!" she said to me while taking a fighter pose.<br><br>"Excuse me?" I said the only thing that came to my head. Did she go crazy?<br><br>"No excuses!" She said as she ran towards me.<br><br>"But I didn't say anything !!"<br><br>Ahh! I cried out in pain when I felt a kick in the belly. Damn it! I will not be serving as a punching bag for this crazy woman!<br><br>I tried to get up and attack, but she easily dodged all my attacks, I tried to use my feet, but it didn't work either.<br><br>Damn it! Is she a ninja!? In fact, what the hell was she!?<br><br>Ahh! I cried out in pain when she kicked me to the floor and kicked me in the face holding my hands.<br><br>I tried to get out of her immobilization, but it was useless.<br><br>"Do you understand, Adrian? You don't know the difference between 'strength' and 'violence', do you?" she said to me while loosening my arms a little.<br><br>"What is the difference!?" I screamed. Isn't it all the same!? I quickly ran away from her and grab a stone halfway and throw it at her, but she deflects it easily as if the stone was too slow.<br><br>Damn it! She's fast! Or am I slow!?<br><br>What? She disappeared!? Ah!! I cried out in pain when she appeared beside me and kicked me in the face.<br><br>I tried to get up and fight back, but she unbalanced me with her feet, when I tried to get up again, she used her knee to attack my belly.<br><br>"Used incorrectly ... Violence!"<br><br>Ugh!! I spit out blood when I felt pain in my stomach. It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! I never felt such pain in my life, damn it!<br><br>"You decide whether you're wrong or right! Not using your strength is also a show of strength! It all comes down to your 'intention'! Don't just use your strength, use your head. Use everything at your disposal!"<br><br>Use everything at my disposal, huh? That's crazy! She's hitting a child! I want my rights! Damn it! My belly hurts, I'm getting tired, this was the worst day of my life! What was that taste?<br><br>I spit a little to the side and saw something red. Blood!? I am bleeding! She is officially crazy! Wait...<br><br>I spit my blood out of my mouth on Nat's face<br><br>Apparently, she didn't expect this attack, I take advantage of the moment she let her guard down, and I attacked her face, but she turned away? How? Is that even possible!?<br><br>"Good move, boy. It looks like you have talent." She said as she approached me with her eyes closed.<br><br>"How is this possible!? You shouldn't be seeing anything now!" I screamed for explanations.<br><br>"Yes, I can't see anything, but I can feel your presence, and I can hear your breath just like that, I can deduce where you are located."<br><br>Hearing this nonsense, I looked at her as if she were a monster, really! This was beyond an ordinary human!<br><br>"Now, you will pay for smearing my face with blood." She said to me smiling 'gently' while wiping the blood off her face.<br><br>I started to shake with fear, I don't want to be beaten again ... I have to think of a way to get out of this without being beaten too much! Damn it! Where's my overprotective mom when I need her? Wait ... Mother? Right! I had this method from the beginning.<br><br>I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.<br><br>"Hmm? Giving up? I'm disappointed boy."<br><br>I ignored her provocation and shouted, "MOTHER!!"<br><br>My scream was so loud that it echoed everywhere we were.<br><br>"Hey, boy! This is unfair!" she complained to me.<br><br>"You said I should use everything at my disposal, right!?"<br><br>"Adriiiannn!!" Hearing my mother's cry from far away, I sighed in relief.<br><br>It looks like it will take time to arrive.<br><br>"UHAAA!" I screamed in alarm listening to a voice by my side. Looking in the direction of the voice, I saw my mother.<br><br>"Fast! How did you get here so fast!?" Are there any normal people in my life!?<br><br>"With the power of love!" she said smiling at me.<br><br>That doesn't explain anything! What the hell is love power!?<br><br>"Adrian ... who did this to you?" she asked me with a 'loving' smile.<br><br>I smile innocently and said, "It was Aunt Nat!"<br><br>My mom turned to Nat like a predator that has found its prey.<br><br>"Adrian, you traitor!" Aunt Nat yelled at me, but I don't care! I still feel my whole body hurting!<br><br>"Good luck Aunt Nat, I will remember you!"<br><br>I started walking towards my house, totally ignoring the screaming sounds that came from the direction I just came.<br>`,

		chapter: `Earth Alone<br><br>The time was April. The university newbie left the room as soon as the lecture ended before everyone else at 2:45. He did not want anyone to recognise him as not an outsider, though no one knew him as such hence he would not have been stopped anyways; he still resolutely walked on to the hill road outside of the plaza.<br><br>There, he felt the unexpected change for the first time.<br><br>‘No one’s around…’<br><br>There was a huge number of people in lectures that ended at 2:45 Sure, not all of them were like Yoo Il Han Il Han, an outsider returning home, yet the complete absence of people in the plaza as well as in the hill road was strange.<br><br>‘Carnival is not on today. Was there a school event?<br><br>Even so, there was no need to feel strange. Yoo Il Han Il Han exited all invited chat groups ever since he attended his university! It was not as if he left out of pressure, it was solely out of his choice!<br><br>Sensing sorrow out of vain, Yoo Il Han walked down the hill valiantly in spite of the dearth of people. He wanted to hitch a ride on a shuttle bus, but there were no vehicles to be seen.<br><br>Was there a military exercise in the university? Perhaps a school wide hide-and-seek? All kinds of thoughts came into his head but he dismissed them readily. For twenty-odd years he had never held hands with a girl, and the lack of other presences right now was nothing in comparison.<br><br>However, those musings dissipated as soon as he exited the school entrance.<br><br>‘What?’<br><br>There was no one.<br><br>‘What the hell!’<br><br>No one was around!<br><br>‘What’s going on. What’s going on!’<br><br>In panic, Yoo Il Han repeated the same phrase inanely as he ran around. No-one. To conjure up a crazy idea like a mass picnic was impossible. The situations were too alarming to escape reality.<br><br>No one. No human to be seen!<br><br>He looked through the windows of the convenience store he often visited. The meal on a table was emitting warm vapour, the chair was pulled slightly back as if someone was sitting on it moments before. Furthermore, spoons and chopsticks were erratically thrown aside, giving them a sense of their users abruptly disappearing out of thin air.<br><br>This oddity applied for all shops. Incidentally, how about parked cars? Moving cars that were in traffic had violently collided in such a way that they lost their drivers, with some on the verge of explosions due to leaking, ablaze gasoline.<br><br>‘Damn it’<br><br>His mind may have been in disarray, but Yoo Il Han identified the hazard and escaped to a vehicle-less street. The reverberation of explosions like the ones in films soon tickled his ears.<br><br>Wind carrying the hot air blew, and Yoo Il Han fled like he was drifting on the wind. Then he shed pointless tears.<br><br>His mind was puzzled back together at a bus station.<br><br>‘Let’s go home’<br><br>Maybe after he washed and ate his mother’s meals, maybe after he slept, things would be different.<br><br>Foolish ideas again sprouted the moment the crises were over. His fantasies were broken quickly this time though .The bus was simply not arriving.<br><br>‘What the fuck. What’s going on.’<br><br>Yoo Il Han prided himself over his mental fortitude. From primary to high school, he overcame everything by his own effort. As a result, he was attending a quite reputable university, and he was confident to do well on his own for a foreseeable future.<br><br>The chinese character ‘person’ is to symbolise two men relying on each other; he never needed such weak stuff. Yoo Il Han always believed that he was like an upright number ‘1’-someone could accomplish anything unassisted<br><br>But, this was too much to handle<br><br>‘Have I alone moved to a different world?<br><br>His situation was too out-worldly that he said something so stupid. Nothing was changing. The bus was not coming, his knees were swelling in pain due to reckless running. Growing sadder every minute, he noticed his tears falling onto the bare earth like bird-droppings.<br><br>‘Pathetic, crying over trivial matters as a university student. No, fuck it. If I don’t cry now, over what would I ever weep? Isolation during his primary school days has made me dismal before, now the entire district is avoiding me.’<br><br>Knowing crying wouldn’t change anything, Yoo Il Han came back to his senses swiftly. It was feverishly hot and tiring. Home was his priority.<br><br>‘Let’s walk’<br><br>Despite the knowledge that no one was there to hear him speak, he shouted in hope for someone to reveal oneself. Yoo Il Han embarked on an hour-and a half journey shrouded in an added layer of disappointment to the obvious result.<br><br>Of course, his mother wasn’t present. He tried to check the time, yet all clocks, including those in mobile phones and computers, were stopped. Dad wasn’t coming either, Yoo Il Han concluded following a couple of hours of waiting as he stared at the everlastingly blue sky.<br><br>The TV only showed static screens, the radio the same and the internet was not working. It was like humanity itself had vanished. Except himself, who was trapped in a stagnant time.<br><br>At least, water and gas pipes worked. He showered and cooked a package of instant noodles.<br><br>Slurp…Delicious<br><br>The taste deepened his sadness and more tears flowed down. He was drowzy now that he was full. I don’t care for the mass disappearance, and whether or not the night was arriving, I must sleep. Possibly, something may become different as I sleep. He laid on his bed in these complacent thoughts. At that moment…`,

		chapter: `<br><br>In the past, a war between the existences that humanity refers to as 'Gods' or 'Demons', destroyed planets, stars, and galaxies; caused the entire universe to tremble.<br><br>However, one of those Gods opposed all of them... because of a woman.<br><br>In the future, a war between the one who was once the strongest but was forgotten by the river of time, and those who planned against him, will make the universe tremble once again.<br><br>*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*<br><br>Shanghai, also known as the pearl of the east, is the largest city in China and Asia's economic center. Anyone who has been to Shanghai knows that its modernity has nothing to envy to cities like New York.<br><br>Although Shanghai remains deeply linked to its history of more than 3000 years, the city today seems to be taken from a science fiction film where modernity and globalization have taken the lead.<br><br>_____________________________<br><br>Luxury Villa Complex - Golden Emperor.<br><br>As one of the most luxurious villa complexes in Shanghai, the Golden Emperor villa complex enjoyed a great reputation not only for the luxury villas presented for sale; but also because it was only 20 minutes away from the University of Shanghai.<br><br>The cheapest villas had an 8-digit value, while the most expensive villas had an excellent 9-digit sales value.<br><br>Sitting on a large sofa, a young man and a woman watched the news with great anticipation and enthusiasm at the same time.<br><br>The young man was 20 years old, his eyes were dark and his hair slightly disheveled. He could be considered as quite tall as the average height of Chinese men was 5.5 feet while he was 6.0 feet.<br><br>His appearance was normal. At best, it could be described as above average. However, if someone were to look closely, they would notice that his body was actually in great condition.<br><br>The girl was 19 years old and incredibly beautiful, unlike the normal appearance of the young man. Her soft, long black hair fell down her waist freely without any restraints. Her body proportions were practically perfect, big but not explosive breasts, excellently shaped butt, thin waist, and silky white skin.<br><br>The young man's name was Xie Feng, and the girl next to him was Xie Yao, his childhood friend.<br><br>Because her parents died in an unfortunate car accident 2 years ago, he and she only had each other.<br><br>Although Xie Yao had more family, she didn't bother to contact them often; therefore, Xie Feng didn't bother either. Fortunately for both of them, Xie Yao's father was a wise person and had already prepared himself in case such an unfortunate situation arose.<br><br>Today, Xie Feng and Xie Yao owned a company valued at more than 1 billion Chinese yuan on the market.<br><br>While they both go to university, the family butler, who also saw Xie Yao's father as his own son, was in charge of maintaining the finances.<br><br>Xie Feng and Xie Yao visit the company regularly to show their faces and learn more about how they work. After all, when they graduate from university, they will have to take care of their right.<br><br>(A/N: There are many "her" that seem to be wrong (when talking about family), but actually, they were put that way for a reason, this is revealed in chapter 14-15 or so).<br><br>"Today, Thursday January 25th 2030, is one of the most awaited days by all humanity, especially for those who love the virtual world and those who are looking for new business opportunities."<br><br>From the plasma screen, the voice of a beautiful woman resonates.<br><br><br>"Why don't you tell us more about it?"-Her co-worker asked, clearly it was a typical script prepared in advance because there is no way that anyone in their right mind could not know what would happen today.<br><br>"Because today at 12 noon, the official opening of Samsara Online will begin.<br><br>Samsara Online, the first virtual reality video game that is 100% supported by the World Central Bank.<br><br>As you all know, the World Central Bank is formed by all the most important banks in the world. This means that everyone in the world will be able to exchange real money for gold within the world of Samsara Online as soon as the currency exchange is available!"<br><br>This is one of the most amazing things about Samsara Online. Although there have been several virtual reality games in the past, the World Central Bank has always stood aside no matter how much profit you can make from them.<br><br>Due to the lack of confidence and ignorance about when a game could suddenly close, people did not dare to risk their money for gold within the game.<br><br>However, with the World Central Bank putting a foot in the door, everything changed.<br><br>In the past, the virtual reality world was mainly taken as a means of entertainment by each player. But now, players will have more opportunities to live than they love, but investors from all over the world will begin to move in.<br><br>After all, Samsara Online is a new unexplored world with infinite opportunities available, waiting to be discovered. Business tycoons and geniuses naturally know what this means, so obviously, they will not let such an opportunity slip through their fingers.<br><br>This means that the economy of the whole world and humanity's decisions will take a big turn when Samsara Online officially starts.<br><br>The beautiful journalist continued:<br><br>"Samsara Online is a virtual world in which there are several types of magic and skills unique to each character. Besides, according to Miss Eva, creator of Samsara Online, a seemingly unlimited amount of equipment and elements with different types of qualities are available within the game.<br><br>Not only that, the most incredible thing is that the NPCs within Samsara Online were developed with the most advanced AI (Artificial Intelligence) available to date, so all players can expect a fluid dialogue as a human being by each NPC-.."<br><br>Xie Feng turned off the TV without waiting for the journalist to finish speaking, but this is also natural since he was looking for information on every internet forum to not miss anything.<br><br>Xie Yao looked at Xie Feng and said cheerfully:<br><br>"Big brother Xie Feng, Samsara Online will finally start"<br><br>Xie Feng also looked at her with a smile and responded:<br><br>Since the last virtual reality game closed 10 months ago, Xie Feng felt that he missed an important part of his life.<br><br>So, when he learned about the launch and qualities of Samsara Online 3 months ago he felt like being reborn from the ashes just like a dying phoenix.<br><br>Besides, something inside him told him that Samsara Online would be very different from previous virtual reality games.<br><br>"Big brother Xie Feng, what kind of character will you choose this time?" -Xie Yao asked with a sweet smile on her face.<br><br>At Xie Yao's question, Xie Feng smiled and replied:<br><br>"What do you think? Naturally, I will choose the assassin class."<br><br>In all previous virtual reality video games, Xie Feng always chose the battle style of an Assassin, so he feels more comfortable using an assassin character.<br><br>"And what style of battle will you choose, Yao'er?" -This time it was Xie Feng's turn to ask Xie Yao.<br><br>Xie Yao crossed her arms as she thought for a moment. After thinking carefully for several seconds and reaffirming her previous choice, she responded:<br><br>"I will choose the Priest class! Unfortunately, the big brother Xie Feng is an Assassin and generally moves in the background, unlike a warrior who needs a Priest's support in certain situations. Otherwise, I could heal you and protect your back."<br><br>You could feel a little bit of sadness in Xie Yao's tone. Because Xie Feng always chooses the same fighting style, she cannot be with him too long in the virtual world as the Assassins need to move through the shadows and become invisible, so the presence of another person would ruin the surprise factor when attacking.<br><br>Xie Feng smiled bitterly at Xie Yao's words. He approached her and gave her a hug while gently kissing her on top of her silky hair.<br><br>When Xie Yao felt the embrace of the only person close to her, all the slight sadness she felt just moments ago was completely gone. She simply closed her eyes and enjoyed the family warmth she felt at this moment.<br><br>After hugging for several minutes in silence, Xie Feng raised his face and looked at the clock hanging on one of the walls.<br><br>That was the exact time marked by the clock. That meant that there were only 33 minutes left for the Samsara Online server to officially start for the first time.<br><br>At that moment humanity will enter a completely new and unknown world that will affect the development of the real world and the economy of every person for the first time.<br><br>The more he thought about it, the more excited Xie Feng was.<br><br>Although a little reluctantly, Xie Yao gave up Xie Feng's hug so that the two of them could prepare to enter the game. Therefore, he and she returned to their respective rooms.<br><br>After entering his room, Xie Feng lay comfortably in his bed and looked at the current time again:<br><br>Xie Feng wore his right hand on a silver-colored necklace that hung around his neck. This necklace is the device that allows the user's mind to connect to Samsara Online's main server.<br><br>Because in the past there were many problems with the old gaming devices, such as losing the account of a large number of users after losing the device, the major corporations in charge of developing virtual reality video games put a lot of effort into creating this object.<br><br>The necklace allows that, after saving your fingerprints and iris information in any of the centers that sell the device, the account is registered through those data.<br><br>That way, even if the device is lost or broken for some reason, people don't need to start from 0 and lose all their previous progress.<br><br>Xie Feng gently pressed the small button in the center of the collar. After the button was pressed, a green light began to flash slightly.<br><br>Soon, Xie Feng felt sleep attacking him, and his eyes began to close. Aware that the gaming device was trying to send his consciousness into the virtual world, Xie Feng cooperated and closed his eyes.<br><br>"Welcome to Samsara Online! I am your fairy presenter, you can call me Jade! Samsara Online is conceived by many as the future second world of humanity and to live up to the expectations placed on us, we have developed a world in which magic is possible, unlike the past virtual worlds in which there were only simple skills!"<br><br>In a completely white world, a small pixie the size of a palm with transparent wings appeared in front of Xie Feng.<br><br>Xie Feng did not waste any time and listened to the little fairy speak without missing a word.<br><br>"Within the world of Samsara Online, you can choose different types of lives. From a miner, chef, or a warrior who fights against fierce monsters trying to reach the top of the world. The map of Samsara Online is enormously vast, waiting for you to discover it. Now let me tell you about the 5 main cities:<br><br>Eminentis City: It is located at the northern end of the world of Samsara Online. Eminentis City is the city where you and all the players will start at the beginning of the game after you leave the beginner's village. To leave the beginner's village and enter Eminentis City, you must first reach level 10.<br><br>Lumence City: Located at the east of the map, the level of the monsters surrounding Lumence City is higher than the level of the monsters surrounding Eminentis City, so you must be careful if you try to get there before having the right level and strength.<br><br>Redemption City: Located west of map and also known for being an area with extremely low temperatures. The level of the monsters is approximately the same as the monsters surrounding Lumence City however, due to the cold, the difficulty of fighting in this part of the map increases several folds. Remember to wear a coat!<br><br>Requiem City: Requiem City is located at the southern end of the map, completely opposite Eminentis City. The level of monsters surrounding the map goes from level 80 to level 100! This makes the areas of the map surrounding Requiem City off-limits to novice players!<br><br>Grandeux City: Grandeux City, also known as the Imperial City As you may have guessed, it is located in the central part of the Samsara world map. Grandeux City is the city where the highest authority of Samsara Online lives, the emperor. Players will be able to enter the Imperial City after reaching level 50."<br><br>The little fairy, Jade, gave Xie Feng some knowledge about cities, which was not available in the internet forums.<br><br>Xie Feng listened carefully and memorized every word. Although it was not information with a high level of importance, it is better to remember every little detail whenever possible.<br><br>After talking about the 5 major cities and some small towns and villages surrounding them, Jade smiled happily and said:<br><br>"It is now 11:40 AM and the Samsara Online server will officially start in just 20 minutes! You can take advantage of these 20 minutes to see your natural statistics and create your character!"<br><br>'Finally, here it is!' -Xie Feng thought to himself.<br><br>The first step will finally be officially taken.<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>In my life, I felt that I was only loved by none other than my sisters, my mother, and my childhood friend. I always had been beaten up by the other students, calling me a pricky ugly little bitch. I was bullied here and there, heck; even my father tried to kill me.<br><br>I never understood why they did this to me; why they treated me like this. They're scum, the whole system of humanity is scum, people are scum, everyone is scum. It's as if the world was made for scum to live in and the beings that live on this planet are far worse than demons could ever get. I never wanted this life, but why did that so-called god give me this fucking life!<br><br>As I woke from my slumber, I looked at myself in the mirror. My black hair, with a lot of strands of white, is dishevelled. I may have moved around a bit too much whilst sleeping. I have dark-brown eyes that barely even looked brown; it just looks black.<br><br>I proceeded to look at my ruined face. My eyes couldn't help but be driven with pure anguish as I saw the various scars covering me. My eye was encompassed with a purplish hue and had a slight bump. Just then, I remembered what had happened; I was beaten up yesterday.<br><br>Without saying anything, I just gritted my teeth as I walked out of my room only to meet my bastard dick father. I just gritted my teeth as I tried to walk past him, but then, he grabbed me by the shoulder, pulling me and made me look directly at his face.<br><br>"Hey! you fucking dick-head, how many times have I told you to fucking respect me!", shouting out loud, he punched me in the face creating a red bump it. Slight blood leaked from my mouth whilst I fell onto the ground, feeling pain all over my body.<br><br>Without doing anything else, I then said with pure anger in my eyes as I looked up at him, "I'm sorry dad, I'm an insolent brat who never knows how to respect anyone, please forgive me."<br><br>My father was not pleased with me. With that said, he stomped on my face and shouted loudly, "Fucking dick-heads should kneel and never look at me, or I'll fucking kill you."<br><br>I didn't even talk back as I kneeled and bowed my head that reached the floor, I as if kowtowed in front of him. If I were only stronger and could help support my sister and mother, I wouldn't have done this. I then said with a trace of anger in my voice, in which he didn't notice, "I'm sorry dad."<br><br>My father then stepped on my head one more time whilst smiling widely, "That's good; that's good." He left with apparent mockery surging from his eyes, the gateway to the soul. I only felt anger rising up. I could barely stand up at the moment as I tried to walk whilst limping towards the bathroom.<br><br>Tears started to well up in my eyes. I cried with anger in my heart, blaming the gods of the curse that had befallen before me. I rinsed my body with the water, dripping from the shower whilst I punched the wall in front of me. I then, without thinking, mindlessly said, "Why do I have to live this life? If there is a god out there, why did you make me, only to suffer?"<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I didn't have any appetite at the moment, so I decided to skip a meal. It's as if I started to hate eating just because of the people who choose to bully others without any fucking reason except to satisfy their sadistic desires.<br><br>I walked up to my room, slightly afraid to see my father. I am weak; in this world, the strong suppress the weak. We are no different from the jungle; if you have power, you are stronger than anyone.<br><br>Changing my clothes to my uniform, I looked up to the mirror again, seeing my face which wasn't overly ugly, but it's indeed below average. My heart quenched. It was due to the reason that if I'm getting this bullied and beaten up just because I'm below average; how about those people that are really ugly?<br><br>I placed a bandage on my wound as I walked out of the room. Just as I was about to leave, someone called me, "Riku! Please wait!", I proceeded to look back and saw my loving mother, rushing towards me.<br><br>She ran up to me only to kiss my cheek, which I utterly appreciated. I then looked at her worried expression as she saw my beat-up face. Her brown hair waved lightly as she stared at me with her violet-coloured eyes. "Did your father do this?"<br><br>I didn't even talk back; I just looked sideways as I gritted my teeth and tears started to form on my eyes. My father wasn't like this when I was still young; he even protected me every time, but now... Now...<br><br>My mom could only hug me tightly whilst my little sister came out from her room and saw me. Her hazel eyes were also filled with tears. My father hadn't spared my sisters to the beatings; in fact, he beats them up altogether. (Just why…?), I questioned myself.<br><br>She then ran up to me and hugged me as well whilst subtly sobbing in my arms. "Nii-san", she then clenched her first along with my clothes as she cried. My mother then hugged both of us tightly as she gritted her teeth while looking towards the room her husband slept in.<br><br>I patted my little sister's head and dishevelled her brown hair whilst smiling as I said, "It's gonna be alright. I'll protect you from him." I then looked at my mom whilst asking, "Where's nee-san?"<br><br>My mom had a dejected look on her face as I mentioned my elder sister. She then said, "She couldn't handle it, she left. She was still injured too. She's reckless!", I then embraced my mom tightly and kissed her cheek, "I'll find her, don't worry, if I have enough money, I'll take you guys out of here."<br><br>I tried reporting my father to the police before, but, the so-called "lawful" people won't even touch him just because of his previous status when he was a soldier. Indeed an unfair treatment, right? Just because of his high rank, and possibly his association with a couple of generals, he gets his freedom anywhere he goes.<br><br>I left the room as I gave a peck to both my little sister's and mom's cheeks as we heard a shout coming from the place my mom looked at earlier. "Reika! Come here now!"<br><br>My mom could only bite her lip, causing it to bleed as she walked towards the room. I patted my little sister's head once more as I said, "Hina-chan, I'll go now, go to school later, ok?"<br><br>Hina, my sister, just nodded her head as I walked out of the house. She stared at my back as if wanting to feel my warmth again. She extended her hand just to pull it back as she went inside the house.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>As I walked into the gate of the school, I was met by gazes and glares filled with disgust. Why did they have to treat me like this?<br><br>Without saying anything else, I just walked at the sidelines, afraid to be stared at by the people. Then, someone grabbed my arm. I was scared at that time. But then as I saw the face of who held me, I couldn't help but smile happily seeing an overly familiar face. It was my childhood friend, who never turned on me like the others. She treated me to everything; she actually cared about me.<br><br>She then smiled at me with her ice-blue eyes as her silver hair waved. As she saw my dishonourable appearance, she said, "Did your father beat you up again?", I just nodded at her question as I continued to walk.<br><br>In this world, the girl beside me is considered a beauty. Her name was Ruri; she is a caring girl. She never got close to anyone other than me and some few other people who turned their back on me. Just because Ruri was close to me, they didn't even consider her a friend.<br><br>I just smiled bitterly at this thought as I walked up to the classroom only to be met angry glares. Whilst walking inside, I felt a slap hitting my face. It was one of the guys who are one of the extremist simps of Ruri.<br><br>He then looked at me and said, "Hey ugly bitch, why are you standing so close to Ruri-sama, she must be disgusted by you!", at that time, Ruri's eyes darkened as she slapped the guy whilst speaking harshly, "You have no right to call my dear friend an ugly bitch! You have no right to call him disgusting! Take a look at yourselves in the mirror! Just because you were blessed with that appearance doesn't make you an all-so powerful god!"<br><br>My heart fluttered slightly seeing that Ruri defended me. With that, I clenched my hand into a fist and sighed lightly as I said, "Thank you, Ruri-san, thank you for defending me." I then walked towards my seat and sat down.<br><br>The class started, yet it ended so quickly as if it was only a second. I then walked out of the class whilst saying goodbye to Ruri. Trying to avoid everyone, I quickly ran towards the gates, but then I was pulled by someone and was directly punched on the face.<br><br>I looked at the guy who did it and noticed, (It's the guy from earlier), he gritted his teeth whilst looking at me and shouted loudly, "You bastard! Why does Ruri-san consider a chicken and an ugly bastard like you as a friend! I'll beat you up!"<br><br>He punched me, kicked me, hit my balls, and broke my arm. I had tears stuck in my eyes, but I didn't shout, I only held my voice. I was breathing raggedly and looked at the guy angrily. He was smirking… the bastard was smirking seeing my state. This burnt my last fuse as I could barely stand up and punched him using my other arm in the face and kicked him in the balls too.<br><br>I then ran immediately whilst limping slightly to the outside the gates. But never did I know that my sister was there getting chased by two older men and a young guy. They grabbed her to an alleyway forcefully as they said, "Hello there, nee-chan, why don't you let us play with you? Have some fun, you know? hehehe."<br><br>I might be afraid of things, but I would never chicken out if my family were involved. I immediately grabbed a pipe that was lying on the ground and hit the guys in the heads, causing them to get knocked out. It was like the injuries disappeared for a split second due to the adrenaline that was coursing through my body, and I didn't feel pain. Unfortunately, it didn't last because as soon as I was finished, it came knocking back at me, causing me to fall down on the ground while twitching.<br><br>My sister, who saw me, immediately stood up and ran towards me and shouted, "Riku-kun! Are you alright, Riku-kun!", seeing that I was unconscious, she grabbed me and carried me towards the house.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>As soon as we arrived, it was already night. My mother quickly opened the door with a scratch, clearly shown on her face. Seeing the state I was in, she embraced my sister and me as she said, "Riku! Aoi!"<br><br>She immediately carried me to the house, including my sister, and immediately dressed up my wounds and bandaged them. She also addressed my broken arm and made a cast using bandages. Just at that time, I heard a slap. I then forcefully opened my eyes and saw my father slapping my elder sister repeatedly as he shouted, "You bitch! You go out for no reason! You come back after! Fuck you! You are no longer part of this family you slut!"<br><br>My elder sister then did one thing I could never do, slap my father. She then shouted, "Fuck your family! Fuck you and your shitty fucking face! I never wanted to be your fucking daughter! I never wanted to be your fucking family! I'm leaving, and you should go fucking die!"<br><br>Just as my father heard what she said, he punched my sister in the face as he shouted, "Then fucking GET OUT!", even I couldn't handle it anymore. I was already burnt out, so I punched my father in the nose using my arm that wasn't particularly broken, causing it to bleed, "I will leave too, including my sister and mother, fuck you, you bastard!"<br><br>I then grabbed my mother and knocked on the door of my little sister and shouted, "We're leaving!", my father was so mad that he exclaimed, "No fuck! You can't leave this place! I am the father! And YOU obey ME!"<br><br>I then shouted as well, "NO SHIT! I WILL FOLLOW MY RULES, AND YOU CAN DO NO SHIT ABOUT IT!", Just as my sister, Hina, walked out, I grabbed her including my mother, and walked out.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"Riku, I have a small apartment, we should stay there", Aoi then said, and I just smiled at her and said, "Sure! Let's go there!", we then followed Aoi towards an old apartment. It was run-down, to be honest, but it is still livable.<br><br>We then walked inside the apartment and inside, was rather dirty, but a little cleaning could fix it. I then smiled bitterly at this sight as I said with a solemn expression this time, "Mom, Aoi-nee, Hina-chan, I'm gonna go to another city."<br><br>They were indeed shocked at what I said as my mother asked, "Why? We could stay here and—", but I cut her off in the middle as I said, "Mom, I will find a job, I will make sure to return every week okay? I am planning to go now, but... We forgot to bring our clothes..."<br><br>As I said that, my mom noticed as she said with an awkward voice, "Y-yeah, we did forget about it, but my friends should have clothes fitting for all of the girls! Y-yeah! But you, on the other hand..."<br><br>I just shrugged and said, "Don't worry about me, it's alright after I get my job, I could buy clothes, but...", I then looked down and saw that I was wearing my uniform, "Yeah, I can't go out wearing these."<br><br>Just at that time, Hina pointed her finger up to her chin as she suddenly remembered something and excitedly told me, "Nii-chan! I have your clothes here!", I looked at her whilst she grabbed her bag that I didn't notice during the way. After that, she showed me a set of clothes, and as you may have guessed, it was my clothes.<br><br>I couldn't help but weirdly asked, "Uh... umm... why do you have my clothes, Hina?", I looked at Hina who was just giggling as she said, "I love nii-san after all!", she then hugged me so suddenly that I caused me to be surprised.<br><br>I then patted her head whilst grabbing the clothes that Hina presented and said, "Be careful! And don't ever get close to him again, I'll be back as fast as I can" After saying so, they all nodded their heads. They had a bit of a sentimental feeling looking at me as I was about to leave.<br><br>I was touched, to be honest, and I, at that time, kissed all of them in the cheeks as I embraced them all while saying with my voice full of love, "I love you all! And I will always love you!"<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I grabbed my phone whilst riding the train to find a source of entertainment. After all, I need any kind of entertainment to clear my mind out of the problems I faced. But before I could see movies, I decided to watch the news I found interesting.<br><br>'Meteorites kept falling and falling, causing cities to get destroyed! is this really the end of the world!?'<br><br>'Various deaths have been found due to meteorites fallin—'<br><br>'The meteorites that fell are filled with radiation causing people to have a genetic mutation! New race confirmed?"<br><br>I turned his phone off as I murmured with pure annoyance in my voice, "This is clearly bullshit, what do they think of this world? An anime? A movie? geh, they even said clear crappy bullshit by saying radiation, he genetic mutation, but... The meteorites, They might be real, and it can be hazardous..."<br><br>I then walked out of the train as it arrived at my destination. It was nice to take a breath of fresh air. I proceeded to grab my phone and contacted Aoi, the only person that had a phone since my mom and Hina couldn't bring one due to rushing out.<br><br>"Hello? Riku!" I heard the voice of my sisters and my mom that made my heart warm up. I showed a wide smile as I responded, "Mom! Hina! Aoi-nee! I arri-", but what happened next, was a thing I never expected to happen.<br><br>A meteorite fell from the sky directly unto me, and I didn't expect it. I was feeling pain all over as my body was crushed, and the call was ended. My mom and sisters then shouted in great worry as they had a bad premonition, "RIKU!"<br><br>Even Ruri, who was far away, had a premonition so bad, she couldn't help but look towards a particular direction as she murmured, "Riku...!"<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Edited: 21/11/2020 By me, the author<br><br>If you want to see character pics and be able to be updated when a new chapter comes out, join my discord server:<br><br>https://discord.gg/xds4MeRGdY<br><br>If you are an aspiring author or just a reader that wants good sauces, good novel recommendations and such, join this other discord server:<br><br>https://discord.gg/SZnQN5XVFE<br><br>If you want to show your support of my work, check out my ko-fi page! ******* is still in progress:<br><br>https://ko-fi.com/omniverse_creator<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>"Hello, Mister Joyce. My name is Samuel Morgan, we were talking on the phone last week." After entering into the hot smithy, a young man with short, dark blonde hair and glowing blue eyes walked up to a man standing in front of an anvil while he was still hammering down onto the hot metal in front of him. The man, Benjamin Joyce, turned around in surprise and layed the metal down with his tongs and began to smile.<br><br>"So you're the kid I'm supposed to meet today? Sorry, I'm working on a little project of mine." Apologizing with a bright smile, he wiped the sweat off his forehead and arms using the towel he always has laying somewhere around himself if he should need it, and then took off his ear-protectors.<br><br>The young man called Samuel loosened his tie and took off his suit-jacket to cool himself off in the searing hot smithy. In any other setting, people might have found this to be rude or unprofessional, but the Benjamin knows how hot it can get inside here. So, without commenting on his action he extended his hand to shake his guest's.<br><br>"Don't worry about it, Mister Joyce. Your skill in different crafts such as blacksmithing is the reason I'm here after all." Laughing slightly, Samuel opened his suitcase on a nearby table and took out something that looked like a contract to Benjamin, laying it out together with a pen,<br><br>"Before we start with the interview, it is necessary for both parties to sign a non-disclosure agreement. For once it is so that you will not spread the information that you get from us. It also protects the secrets of your craft that you may tell me today, so that no member of Prime Industries may tell someone outside the Company. Either way, the information will be handled on a need-to-know basis, so the spread will be minimized. Do you have any questions?"<br><br>Since this wasn't the first time in his life that he had to sign something, Benjamin shook his head and grabbed the contract, reading through it meticulously.<br><br>After a few minutes, he gave a slight nod and took the pen, then looked over at the young businessman.<br><br>"Where do I need to sign?" In response to his question, Samuel began smiling softly. Benjamin figured that he was simply happy for making it so uncomplicated.<br><br>After he pointed at the different spots where his signature was needed, Benjamin signed the contract without any complications. Afterward, Samuel did the same, thus completing the non-disclosure-agreement.<br><br>"Alright, Mister Joyce. Should we start the interview now?" Samuel asked and took out a tablet as well as an electronic pen to use for writing from his suitcase. Benjamin nodded while keeping up his soft smile and pointed at a door leading out into the backyard of his house where his smithy was set up, "Let's talk outside. The weather is beautiful today." He suggested while opening the door and walking over to a table, then sat down on one of the wooden chairs, motioning Samuel to take a seat on the other.<br><br>Samuel looked through the first few questions he noted down and began to speak, "The first section will be-"<br><br><br>"Ah, sorry! Young man, do you want something to drink? Some water, lemonade? A cold beer?" Noticing that Benjamin forgot a basic part of a host's etiquette, he stood up and walked up to the glass sliding door leading to the kitchen. Sighing loudly but knowing this old guy will leave either way no matter what he says, he nodded and asked to get some water. Benjamin himself grabbed a bottle of beer and opened it up before walking back outside.<br><br>"Alright, now. What I was saying, the first section of the interview will be made up of personal questions. Is that fine?" Samuel asked and looked at Benjamin with a soft, professional smile. Since he seemed like quite a good lad, Benjamin decided that he didn't mind telling him and nodded.<br><br>"Thank you. What is your full name, Mister Joyce?"<br><br>"Benjamin Theodore Joyce. My first name is that of my grandfather fatherly side and my second name that of my grandfather motherly side. Something like a family tradition. My own grandchild's name is Benjamin as well, haha. Would you like to see a picture of him? He just got out of elementary school! Here, I have a picture of him in my wallet!" Excitedly Benjamin stood up wanting to grab his Wallet from his Jacket inside, just when he noticed that he was trailing off.<br><br>"Sorry, sorry. I tend to trail off like that sometimes when I'm passionate about something." He apologized and began to laugh embarrassedly.<br><br>"Don't worry, Mister Joyce. I'm very close to my grandfather as well." With a soft smile, Samuel looked down at his Tablet and noted something down. It seemed like he noted more than just Benjamin's name, however.<br><br>"How old are you right now, and at what age did you find your interest in different crafts?"<br><br>The aged Blacksmith leaned back in his chair and took a sip of his beer while he thought, but soon enough remembered when exactly that was, "Right now I'm 66 years old. We were a family of blacksmiths for generations, sadly I'm the one where that tradition stopped. I practically grew up in a smithy, knowing how to properly work with Iron before I could spell. And that's not an exaggeration. I spent a whole month trying to make the perfect Paper Knife for my father when I was just a little boy of five years. Sure, I did get a lot of help from my father's apprentices, but I still like to think I did most of the work, haha." Floating in a nostalgic feeling when thinking back on this, Benjamin smiled deeply.<br><br>"I see. And what about other crafts? I was told you are also very proficient in things like leatherworking, tailoring, and even meddled in some eastern herbalistic lines of work for a while?" Samuel asked his interviewee and continued writing down his notes.<br><br>"Ah… I dropped out of high school when I was 16 to officially become my father's apprentice, and just when I finished it my old man died. He overworked himself because of the stress from many of his other apprentices stopping to work in the profession. After he died, I decided that journeying around the world might be a good idea, since all I knew was in that small, crammed smithy. Until that point, I never even left my hometown. I first traveled through the United States to expand my general knowledge or how to be independent. I worked with some other blacksmiths and refined my techniques even further. But at some point, I began to wonder. Is blacksmithing really the right thing for me, or was that a choice made by my heritage before I was even born? Thus, I left the country and traveled across South America. Mostly on foot, or on boat when necessary, I even spent time with some recently, at the time, discovered tribes and learned how to connect with nature. I learned different Mexican and Carribean cuisines as well while I was at it, working with natural ingredients most of the time.<br><br>After a year, I went over to Europe, and in France met a talented tailor who I worked under for another whole year, and then continued traveling through Europe, picking up as many tricks on traditional crafts as I could. I even lived with a hunter for a month, who showed me how to properly work with leather of an animal you hunted yourself, and how to get the hides without damaging them too much.<br><br>When I was in my mid-twenties, I finally went on to Asia, where I learned about a whole new perspective on the crafts I knew about before. Completely new blacksmithing and tailoring techniques, cuisines that I had never eaten before. To my simple mind that thought it got to know all there was to know in the world this just showed that you can always keep growing, no matter what you do. There, how you already mentioned, I also learned about herbalism, although I had gotten to know the basics from areas like the United Kingdom or central Europe already."<br><br>Benjamin explained in as much detail as he could muster without being completely useless for the rest of the day from reminiscing big parts of his whole life.<br><br>"That's something that many young people dream of nowadays. I myself also always wanted to travel the world like that since I was a child." Samuel pointed out with a big smile.<br><br>"Don't worry about it, lad. You're still young! You can do whatever you want with the rest of your life! You're not an old geezer like me, haha." With a soft laugh, Benjamin took another sip of his beer and waited for Samuel to continue the interview.<br><br>"For saying that you are an old geezer, your body is still one that many people my age would love to have." Samuel smiled softly and then looked at his Tablet again to read through the next question, "This was basically all that the first part included. Since you explained many things in such detail, I was able to skip some of the questions. Now, for the second part. This will be you explaining the mindset you have when you are inside this smithy or committing to any other craft. What makes you want to continue it? What does the profession itself mean to you? These kinds of things."<br><br>After Samuel began explaining what the second segment of the interview will be about, Benjamin thought about it for a while. What do the crafts mean to him? It's simple, really.<br><br>These crafts, especially Blacksmithing, the thing he grew up with, means everything to him. He never was a book-smart man. All he was ever good at was slamming his hammer against metal. Others relied on their brain, while Benjamin relied on his hands. Sure, he gathered a lot of experience in life that may make him seem 'smart', but deep down he knows that he's a handyman. But that doesn't mean that Benjamin only does this because it's the only thing he can, he genuinely loves it. Exactly the fact that he can only work with his hands makes the importance and his reliance on different crafts so strong. It makes him feel like he has a purpose in life as long as he has something to do with his two hands.<br><br>"I'm already long beyond my prime, you know? These days I may have other things to be proud of, like my grandchildren for example, but even then it still calms my mind to just be in here. It reminds me of easier days." Benjamin finished his monologue on the importance of Craftsmanship in his life, even bringing some tears to Samuel's eyes.<br><br>He wiped his sleeve across his face to wipe them away, smiling softly at this speech, "That was truly inspirational, Mister Joyce. Now, I think that was enough for the second phase. Lastly, I will need to record the process of you working. I brought a number of heat resistant cameras so I can set them up in the Smithy as well, effectively recording complete 3D images of you. It would be a great help having you explain different techniques by showing them to me as an example." The young man explained at last. Nodding with a smile on his face, Benjamin emptied his bottle of beer and stretched slightly.<br><br>"Let's go, lad. I'll go and prepare the materials, and you do your tech whatchamacallit."<br><br>"Thank you, Mister Joyce. I'll get right to it!"<br><br>And like that, for the rest of the day, Benjamin taught Samuel all of his tricks and techniques related to blacksmithing, Tailoring, Leatherworking, Herbalism and other smaller details related to other professions.<br><br>After sitting down in his car, sweating profusely after spending hours in this extreme heat, Samuel stares silently at his tablet, muttering out a single thing.<br><br>"So this is what a Legendary Craftsman is like, huh?"<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>I could be what you called an ordinary student. Or on anime terms, the Classmate A. I have neither the attention nor popularity. But despite that, I'm not one of those weak people that was always a target for the bullies. If I can explain it clearly, I am part of the peanut gallery.<br><br>Here in the classroom, there are those main characters such as the Class Couple, the Top 1, the Class President, the Class Idol, the Class Hunk and so on and so forth. Every day will be filled with events surrounding them. I may or may not be implicated by it but I don't mind. In my 16 years of life, I never really had a desire to stand out. It's fine to be the Classmate A. Being Classmate A helped me a lot to avoid unnecessary troubles.<br><br>But despite being the Classmate A, I have a secret desire that no one knew. Since I was a kid, I have this indescribable urge to steal. Well not to steal things, but to steal someone from another. Not that I keep someone I stole for long though, much less is it known by the person I stole from so before that happens I usually give them back once I grew bored.<br><br>If I remember correctly, it started back in the 5th grade. I saw the Class Hunk of that year confess to someone. The girl isn't even that beautiful and I still haven't grown in that department yet, still hairless. But still, I felt an annoying itch inside me to go and steal the girl from him. He might have been the most handsome in class but that did not faze me. It only took me a week to get the girl to fall for me and right after that, I stole her first kiss. And err she also stole my first kiss back then but that's not the point. Anyway, I did all of that without him knowing and without them breaking up during it.<br><br>Then days passed and the kisses levelled up to more. But since there's a lack of sex education at that time, we never get passed kissing and touching. I sucked her tongue regularly though. Especially during mornings, I often pull her out of anyone's sight. The excitement of that grew into me but well, I soon grew bored and let her go. But even though I stopped seeking opportunities to get her, it was she who started longing for me. Not that I mind. We continued that relationship until we graduated, without anyone knowing but us. And during that time, I didn't stop at one. I also got the most popular girl in school and the smartest girl. Thinking about it now really filled me in nostalgia.<br><br>When I entered Middle School, I continued doing the same thing, stealing someone's girl, and finally graduated from my virginity during my 2nd year. It was with a popular upperclassman. It took me a month to get her though since her boyfriend had a tight leash on her. I took my chances when he's not around her. I even tried to ingratiate myself under him to get closer. It worked out anyway so it was worth it.<br><br>Continuing the life of Classmate A, only the girls I got knew the true me. I stopped going to average beauties, but well since extremely beautiful girls were scarce and harder to steal. More importantly, most beautiful and cute girls don't have a boyfriend or they were keeping it a secret. I never set my eyes on single girls, I only enjoy the thought of stealing someone's girl. The excitement I get from it surpasses falling in love with someone. I spent my middle school enjoying lots of girls and most of them were virgins which is a delight.<br><br>Maybe I'm just scared to fall in love and have someone do the same thing I did to me. I can't let someone do that to me, that's why I keep being the ordinary classmate. Now that I'm in High School, it's time to start again.<br><br>I look around the classroom. The class hasn't started yet but most of the students are already inside.<br><br>Groups are already starting to form and those who stand out with their roles, I've already noted.<br><br>For example, that girl with braids and glasses who sits at the middle of the front row. Kanzaki Mio. She's the Class President type. Her height is about average but one thing that stands out is her chest, it's big. If I can guess it's a D cup. Most boys in class are already ogling her since earlier. Kanzaki is sitting seriously there while looking around, checking the faces of her classmates. If ever she has someone, it will really be a challenge for me to steal her. Not that I don't have experience with her type, there's still a slight difference in attitude between High Schooler and Middle Schooler so I will have to put in more effort.<br><br>Along with the ringing of the school bell, the door of the classroom opened.<br><br>Entering it should be our Class Advisor for this year.<br><br>Our teacher turned out to be a beauty as well. A candy for the boys' eyes and that included me.<br><br>On her right ring finger, there's the thing you can only see to someone married. A wedding ring.<br><br>I can't help but smile looking at it. I never tried stealing a teacher back in middle school since there's no one as beautiful as her there plus I'm still young and my taste hasn't expanded to that age yet.<br><br>She seems like a newly graduated teacher and this might be her first advisory class.<br><br>Putting down the books she held on her table, the whole class fell silent.<br><br>She then leaned on her table and took a glance at our faces. After a moment, she turns around and writes something on the board. Her name.<br><br>"Miyazaki Shiori. I'm your advisor for the year. Bear with me okay. This is my first advisory class so I hope you take care of me and I'll do the same thing to you for the rest of the school year." Miss Miyazaki started her introduction.<br><br>"So, for a start. You can ask me anything."<br><br>Hearing that. A lot of boys raised their hands and there are also some girls who are curious about this teacher. This is a common occurrence every start of the year and each time I only need to watch since what I wanted to know will be asked by someone anyway.<br><br>Ms Miyazaki looked down at the paper on her table. On it is the paper the list our names and sitting arrangements.<br><br>"Okay. You first Yamada."<br><br>"Teacher, how old are you?" asked Yamada, who was then followed by a laugh by those around him.<br><br>Ms Miyazaki was taken aback at his question but she immediately recovered from it.<br><br>"You do know it's rude to ask for a girl's age. Don't you Yamada?"<br><br>More laughter followed when they saw the teacher's response.<br><br>More silly questions followed right after. There were serious and more joke questions asked to her. Unlike the first question, Miss Miyazaki never lost composure again and she answered them calmly.<br><br>Looks like she had a good education as a teacher.<br><br>After a rollcall of our names, the Class President was chosen and it didn't come to me as a surprise, Kanzaki was chosen.<br><br>The first period ended that way and we got an hour of break. This is a way to let us be acquainted with each other. The time from before class wasn't enough.<br><br>Since everyone is a new face for me. There's a few who came to talk to me and as the Classmate A, I never turned anyone down and made friends with them. We even exchanged numbers and I was added to a group chat which consisted of everyone in the class.<br><br>The first day of the class ended like that.<br><br>I'm just an observer to everyone and since I got acquainted with them, those near my seat often talked to me which I responded to get a fairly good first impression. I don't need to stand out anyway, as long as I look normal then that's enough.<br><br>Some of the boy's group invited me to go home but I rejected, saying I wanted to stay for a little longer.<br><br>It's not that I have something to do, I just wanted to explore the school. Since this is a new school for me, I need to explore it to find places I might need in the future. Like a hidden spot which I can use when I find a target. I also need to familiarize myself with each and every room like the infirmary, the rooftop, the Principal's Office and the library. Who knows, I might need to use them as well.<br><br>Walking around the school after class hours gives me some sort of peace as well. I always do this even back at middle school. I can see those who purposefully stayed back. Those sports-oriented students and so on.<br><br>The school is quite big so I guessed it would take me an hour to fully explore it.<br><br>When I arrived at the 3rd years' floor though, a surprising scene appeared before me.<br><br>In one of the classrooms, I found a very interesting sight. And yeah. It involves my secret desire.<br><br>"N-no, someone might see us here."<br><br>A girl's voice rang in my ears. It came from an upperclassman inside the room. Though it's soft, I can hear it clearly because of the silent corridor.<br><br>I peek at the door to see inside. There are two people in there. The girl who I heard and another one. I don't need to guess who it is, he must be her boyfriend. To think that they have the nerve to do it on the first day of the school year. I'm amazed.<br><br>Surprisingly, both of them are half-naked, with the girl sitting above a desk. Her skirt was pulled up and her panties were pulled down to her leg. Her uniform was also opened and her bra was pulled up leaving her bare chest opened.<br><br>Her nipples were erect and due to the sunlight outside, it was glistening. Probably, he already sucked on it before I arrived.<br><br>I pulled up my phone and took photos of that scene. I made sure to get both of their faces clearly. <br><br>The boy is currently working on his belt to pull out his cock. But of course. What am I? Seeing this sight invoked my secret desires. I found my first target. <br><br>"Kana, I can't wait anymore. We're already dating for a year."<br><br>The boy said, his face couldn't contain his desire to fuck the girl. Looks like this will be their first time. I wonder if the girl is still a virgin. But still, even when she said that earlier. I can see from her face that she also wanted this to happen.<br><br>I clenched my hand and without holding back, I slammed it on the door. <br><br>The agitated voice of the boy rang almost instantly. They're surely surprised by that so I quietly hid in a corner. I can hear the sounds of them fixing their uniforms and their silent conversation.<br><br>"Kenji, d-do you think someone saw us?"<br><br>"I don't know, sorry Kana. Because of me. I couldn't wait. We should go home. I'll go first. I'll wait for you at the gate."<br><br>I heard the sound of the door opening and saw the boy Kenji running out. He even looked to his left and right and when he found nothing, he went to the stairs.<br><br>I waited a bit, making sure he won't come back before coming out of hiding.<br><br>I can still hear the sound of someone inside. She's probably fixing her clothes which were a mess earlier.<br><br>When she heard the sound of my steps, she immediately became alert.<br><br>I entered the room and closed it shut.<br><br>"Well, that was an interesting sight senpai." I started.<br><br>She immediately took a step back when she saw me entering and closing the door.<br><br>I can feel her wariness through her voice. Well, who wouldn't be? I can guess what she's thinking right now. She's probably thinking that I was the one who slammed the door earlier. <br><br>"Just your ordinary junior senpai," I answered smilingly.<br><br>Dunno about my smile though since she took more steps back.<br><br>"1st year? What are you doing here? This is the 3rd years' floor."<br><br>"Well you see, I thought of exploring the school since I'll be here for 3 years. Never would I have thought to see a very stimulating scene."<br><br>Ah. That's a good expression on her face. She's blushing and the trace of embarrassment showed. She even crossed her arms to cover her chest despite it already fixed. <br><br>Now that I look at her properly, this Kana-senpai is really cute. She's the Cute and Shy type of girl. She has shoulder-length hair, it was decorated by a yellow ribbon hairband. Her forehead was covered by her bangs. Even though she's already in her 3rd year, she still looks child-like. Her chest isn't though. I can still recall the memory of that erect nipple of her. I wonder how it tastes. Well, if I succeed I can experience it soon. I heard that they're already dating for a year and they'll only do it now? I wonder why they chose to do it here though.<br><br>"What do you mean? Are you talking about this?"<br><br>I walk towards her, bringing out my phone. On the screen was the picture I took earlier.<br><br>Her eyes widened when she saw it. And now a trace of fear can now be seen there as well.<br><br>"Huh? Why? This is a really great shot if I must say. You look really cute here senpai."<br><br>I smiled at her and I know that my desire for her can't help but leak out. I'm sure she's also feeling it right now. Well, this is really what excites me. I never knew I could find a target this early in my high school days.<br><br>"No what? I can't understand senpai."<br><br>"P-please delete the picture."<br><br>I pretended to think but I am secretly observing her reactions.<br><br>Her breathing is turning ragged and I can sense her desperateness. Who wouldn't? If someone saw that picture I'm sure they'll be delighted. This cute upperclassman on that pose with her erect nipples exposed. I'm getting hard just thinking about it. Of course, I'm cutting out her boyfriend from the picture.<br><br>"I won't show it to anyone. You see senpai. You look really cute here."<br><br>"W-why? Why are you doing this?"<br><br>Her eyes are turning watery now. A little push and she might really start crying.<br><br>"I like the look on your face here senpai. You look really sexy. I can't delete this but I can promise not to show this to anyone."<br><br>"I swear. But on one condition."<br><br>When she heard the word condition, she took another step back. Because there's a chair behind her she fell sitting on it.<br><br>I stare at her from bottom to top. On my mind, I'm already stripping her. Thinking of plans on how to steal her. This type of girl is one of the easiest. A simple blackmailing can make her fall. Though I said easiest, her type is also the easiest to fail. One wrong move and it will be over. Not that I failed before.<br><br>So here. Let me start my high school with you. I'm really looking forward to it. Kana-senpai.<br><br>"Let's exchange numbers." I answered her with a smile.<br>`,

You will need to successfully put everyone in that world into a dream. That world is heading towards its destruction, so begin from there first.<br><br>Erik:-Irregular world? You do know the danger that infests that world right? Not to mention the broken protagonist and his sister, how am I even supposed to survive there?<br><br>Outer-God:- That where I come in, I will grant you a few abilities which shall help you in your endeavour.<br><br>Erik:- Hmm.....<br><br>Outer-God:- You would ask about your family?

		chapter: `<br><br>"Chapter-1: The Hired Magician pt-1"<br><br>"Huh? It seems that it will be raining, I hope that our shift is over by the time the raining stops….." (Mob.1)<br><br>A tall man, wearing a green-colored military uniform and holding an M4 in his hands mumbled out loud while gazing at the dark sky.<br><br>The moon shone with its usual brilliance even though the dark cloud would soon cover its calming light.<br><br>"Yeah! I don't want to get wet in the rain; also! we need to return to position A." (Mob.2)<br><br>Another tall man, similar to the previous one was standing near his friend while watching over the cargo that was being transported inside the base.<br><br>Both of the soldiers seemed highly trained and well equipped, top-quality assets who would be valued in any armed forces yet the hand-band around their biceps had a very unique symbol on it.<br><br>[A Golden dragon with no head]<br><br>The symbol didn't belong to any armed forces or terrorist group. It belonged to the most notorious syndicate in the world. The name of this syndicate was forbidden to be spoken publicly.<br><br>[No Head Dragon] was an international crime syndicate that abused its ability to use magic.<br><br>The name [No Head Dragon], didn't originate from the organization but was instead used by other organizations to refer to the syndicate because the leader of [No Head Dragon] had never appeared before his subordinates.<br><br>The leader would only appear before his subordinates if an individual had to be punished.<br><br>They would first be rendered unconscious and then taken to a separate location, to a private room.<br><br>Anyway, that is not the focus of the discussion.<br><br>The soldiers guarding the place along with the huge facility behind them belonged to the syndicate, disguised as a dock warehouse.<br><br>[No Head Dragon] had their headquarters all around the world; every developed country had at least one hidden base through which the organization would operate.<br><br>"Has professor Enzo arrived?" Questioned the first soldier while observing the surrounding; keeping an eye on the area.<br><br>"Yes, the professor will be deported from Japan tomorrow. We just need to make sure that no intruder enters the place." Replied the second soldier as he pulled out a cigarette packet; flicking out a single piece.<br><br>"You want one?" He asked his partner while talking out a lighter from his left pocket.<br><br>The first soldier tilted his head to the side and replied in a bored manner.<br><br>"Sure.…."<br><br>The second soldier puts a single piece in his mouth while pulling another for his partner.<br><br>Out of nowhere, a sudden click of something solid impacting the ground resounded throughout the place.<br><br>Both of the soldiers hurriedly pointed their M4s towards the direction from which the sound came, their reflexes were on spot.<br><br>Due to the sudden action, the second soldier had to let go of the lighter, and the packet of cigarettes; even the one in his mouth fell on the ground.<br><br>The first soldier slowly moved forward towards the left portion of the 'warehouse'.<br><br>He gestured for his partner to follow behind him and keep his eyes on the right side.<br><br>The second soldier nodded and nimbly moved behind the first soldier while pointing the barrel of his gun towards the left side.<br><br>Both of the soldiers silently moved in sync and one by one cleared all the areas.<br><br>After 5-minutes of intense search, they found nothing, even so, they didn't drop their guard at all.<br><br>To make things harder, it finally started raining, the dark clouds had finally covered the entire sky; hiding the moon.<br><br>The soldiers had already switched to night vision mode using the gear they were wearing.<br><br>"Hey, Carl…." The second soldier called out his partner's name.<br><br>"Yes?" The first soldier didn't turn around upon being called, rather he continued to keep an eye on the right side.<br><br>"A Shadow can't be cast without a source of light right?"<br><br>"Then why do you have a rather large shadow when the moon is covered by clouds and there isn't a source of light?"<br><br>Before the first soldier could turn around to check his back, a hand extended from his shadow holding a Glock, with a suppressor on, and shot him in the neck.<br><br>The bullet pierced the guard's neck, instantly destroying the windpipe therefore effectively stopping him from making a noise as he was left for dead.<br><br>The second soldier instantly jumped back and aligning his gun with the line of fire between him and the shadow which killed his partner.<br><br>Unfortunately for him, before he could shout or fire his gun, he felt his control over his vocal cords slip past his brain as a tight steel wire sliced half of his throat.<br><br>Like a fountain, blood rushed out of the soldier's throat as he desperately tried to use his gun and fire some shots at his attacker before he died.<br><br>Unfortunately for him, his attacker didn't give him a chance as a bullet pierced his brain, the inertia inside the bullet jerked his head backward as he fell on the ground.<br><br>And just like that, two highly trained soldiers were killed within seconds, after the fight started.<br><br>A couple of seconds later, a figure appeared from the shadow. Dressed in a strange mobile suit.<br><br>Special alloy platted armor with a hood covering the helmet. Purely black with purple lines running all over the [thing].<br><br>The rain intensified, falling onto the dead bodies of the two soldiers. The blood from their wounds was quickly washed away, the figure in the strange outfit picked up their bodies and placed them onto the warehouse gate, he pinned their back to the wall; from afar it looked like the two soldiers were standing straight.<br><br>The lack of vision was extremely helpful to the figure as it helped him cover his tracks. He now had at least an hour before someone found the dead bodies of the two soldiers.<br><br>"Looking at the dead bodies of the two soldiers, I felt nothing..."<br><br>"Just this emptiness inside my heart…."<br><br>"Ever since I came into this world, the emptiness has just kept growing….."<br><br>"As time goes, I don't even know what am I turning into….."<br><br>"I should quickly finish the mission….."<br><br>"Let's just get this over with….."<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>Year 123 of the General World Calendar. Early Winter Period.<br><br>One week before the start of the New year at the Heaven Manor Academy.<br><br>Today was beautiful than usual, everything looks calm, so calm that it was disturbing, suddenly *Screech* the world cried, trembling as if it was rejecting something, or someone from entering.<br><br>Outside Ethernasia, a lone figure dressed entirely in black was silently hovering in the air, it was a man but his face was covered by a black scarf only his eyes were visible, they are crimson in color, so beautiful, so perfect that one would want to steal them and place them in a glass to keep them forever.<br><br>The black-clothed man stopped in the air for a while as if he was mulling over something before he finally opens his mouth to speak, he had an ethereal voice, a little rough, pleasing to the ears and also hypnotic at the same time.<br><br>Once you hear his voice, you will be mesmerized, his voice was such temptation that it was practically impossible not to be influenced. What dangerous individual, just with that voice he could charm almost everyone and get everything he wants. <br><br>''Oh! This world already has its own conscience, its own spirit, even if this spirit is at the stage of a newborn, That's why it reacted like that when I wanted to enter it. No, this kind of reaction is too exaggerated as if someone had altered it to be more hostile if I wanted to enter. I see it must be them. So this is their welcome gift, let me give you mine then.''<br><br>After saying that, he swung his hand as if, he wished to split the world in two, instantly the world spirit screamed again *Screeeeech*, the whole world shook, fiercely jerking. This time it looks like a wailing filled with pain more than a cry of protest. The world barrier was cut in two, the world comes to stop because of an immense pressure descent on the whole world pressuring It. The black-clothed man entered Ethernasia.<br><br>Every single person present in the world felt like some kind of weight had been put on them, the weakest ones instantly lost consciousness, the more powerful shuddered thinking that something probably beyond the God Tier entered the world. Every powerhouse present in the three continents starts sending their specials agents to go collect information, searching for the being or the thing that causes even the World to wails.<br><br>At the same time, in several locations in the world:<br><br>In Neox, capital of the Neon Empire, on the floor zero of the Golden Palace sat in meditation on a mat was an old man with white hair, but you could see a few strands of golden hair mixed in those white hair. A white lightning snake was hovering above his head.<br><br>Having felt the phenomenon he snapped open his golden eyes and look beyond the palace wanting to see what caused the world to wails but he hastily closed his eyes because a pair of crimson eyes look back at him, immediately it was like he saw his own death, he shudders instantly closing his eyes if not he would have died after his eyes burst out. His eyes were bleeding, calming himself he said:<br><br>''I didn't even manage to see that person face, all I perceive is that his eyes look red, redder than anything I ever saw. I almost died because of that, I fear that this person is beyond the God Tier if not I wouldn't be injured with just a look from him. Where does he come From? Better be cautious and not to anger him. Even those old bones from Huxia, Luxon, and even that Sakura Baba must have felt it, and also check it but I bet they also suffer an injury. We will talk about how to treat this super guest at the next world summit. '' Afterwards, he sends a message to Leonardo Nexus V the current emperor, also Leon's father to investigate but with caution, they must never anger this being if they ever saw him.<br><br>The white-haired old man was the ancestor of Leonardo, Kretus Nexus III, an old monster, he was the third emperor of the Neon empire, everyone thought he has already died but he's still alive, he is the last card of the Neon empire. All other empires have one. As he had predicted, all other empires old monsters suffered an injury when they wanted to look at the being that caused the phenomenon.<br><br>Afterward, they all give the same order to all their descendants, the current emperors, or empress. Only the Yydrassil Empire didn't do anything like this doesn't concern them. Even the demon race emperor also send someone to investigate.<br><br>In the Holy Church headquarter, On the highest floor where the Pope is, a meeting was currently taking place in that room.<br><br>Nineteen individuals were seated around a big table, they are men and women. Between those nineteen, one person was seated on a white jade chair beautifully carved, this person is a woman beautiful even with a veil hiding her face, she had a golden hair and golden eyes, she was dressed in a white nun dress. She is the Pope of the Holy Church, Freya P. Claire. The other eighteen persons were naturally the six cardinals and twelve apostles, all of them were dressed in white.<br><br>Freya P. Claire talked, her voice could calm people's heart, forcing them to listen to what she says. On the one hand, it can be said that her voice could be considered a weaker version of the black-clothed man voice.<br><br>''Our Lord didn't forget our prayers, this being has come because of us, but before we will go receive him, you must work harder to convert more human and collect more donations. You must work harder because our Holy Crusade will start now that this being sends by our lord came. It shows that the day we take over the world is near. That all I have to say, go back to your work.'' announced Freya, after hearing what their Pope said, the eighteen look more fired up than usual, the holy crusade will start because their lord envoy has come. They departed shortly leaving Freya alone.<br><br>Once alone, Freya slumped in her big white jade chair, quietly muttering 'Welcome back' nobody heard what she muttered but strangely when she said those words, a pair of crimson eyes look in this direction for a few seconds before vanishing.<br><br>At the Heaven Manor Academy, girl dormitory, twins chamber, Nui, Emea, and Emia were chatting when they sensed the phenomenon and the black-clothed man appearing, the three chuckled. Emea said:<br><br>''I know he will come back, welcome back honey. Kyle, I miss you so much.''<br><br>''I miss him too,'' Emia added.<br><br>''Oh! Looking at your lovely reaction I can help but want him too, can we share him? I think I fell for him for a long time ago, You should know now I won't hide anything from you, I'm serious please think about it.''<br><br>Nui dropped a bomb, the atmosphere chilled instantly, Nui gulped audibly looking nervous, she waited for the two scorns and ridicules but instead, Emia started laughing,<br><br>''Hahahaha, it takes you some time before you gather your courage to say it. I thought you would never announce it. I'm glad that you said it now, don't worry we already know that since some time ago, we are women loving the same man, after all, we know how we look when we are talking about him, sometimes you have the same look, it was how we know that you have a feeling for him., and we are together since our childhood, we're best friend, you know us the best and we also know you, it's normal to know that.''<br><br>''Emia is right, we welcome you with open arms, I doubt you will be the only one to fall for him if he comes to the academy, we will have many sisters. Well, it is not like we are not against it but with what he has become do you think one or two women can satisfy him? Nah! back then he was a beast, now that he became what he's now, he will need a lot of women to satisfy him. You are welcome, but there is no negotiation on who is the first wives.'' added Emea with a smile.<br><br>Nui overjoyed, thanking her new sisters, her fear did not come true.<br><br>In the boy dormitory, in the twin demons Room. Grimm and Lumis were sitting on their bed with frustrated expressions. Lumis sighed,<br><br>''So, he's finally here, damn it, We estimated that he will show up in two weeks not now. Who do leave there to watch over that thing seal?"<br><br>"It's Razael, Don't worry, with him there, the seal will last at least one year. Even now he shows up he won't try anything for some time. We will have time to deal with that thing back home." Grimm answered<br><br>"I hope so," Lumis says. The two looked tired now that man had come back, things will not be easy for them.<br><br>Elsewhere in a room situated on the highest floor of the Zeroth Organization, sitting on a bed was a figure shrouded in darkness, the only thing visible was a pair of heterochromia eyes, one gold and the other red, they look beautiful. The figure noticed the phenomenon<br><br>"Welcome back dear, this time I won't let you go. I know you show up for her and you will definitely go to the academy. Wait for me I'm also coming."<br><br>A figure with an alluring voice that could melt male or female bones alike says. She opened her mouth again but this time she gives an order.<br><br>"Shadow, go procure me an invitation for a transfer in the second year of Class S. I'm counting on you. "<br><br>"Certainly Milady" shadow responded, since the start shadow never appeared, it just answered and disappeared<br><br>In far place, in the middle of the sea, in the former home of the now-extinct angel race. On an almost destroyed island sat a gigantic dark castle, this Dark castle darker than the darkness itself is emitting an eerie presence.<br><br>In the throne room entirely shrouded in darkness, sat on a simple black throne is a figure, from his outline It can be inferred that this person is a woman. Also noticing the phenomenon, the woman opens her eyes, instantly a powerful pressure fell on the whole island, the woman's eyes color was red, so red that they look like blood. Finally retrieving her pressure, the woman talked<br><br>"Welcome back, Father, I was waiting for your arrival."<br><br>"Activate the shadows" she ordered with a cold voice.<br><br>After Kyle entered Ethernasia, he looked in the direction of the academy says:<br><br>"I'm back. So there you are. Strange why there is another person beside you having the same soul signature as you? Well, I will know once I set foot in the academy. To think that all of you will be present in this world, even if two seems to be in a far place, the remaining are all present here on this human continent."<br><br>The human continent also had some little powerhouses, not bad you shouldn't try to play with fire, 'cause you will be caught fire. The black-clothed man mumbled while looking in the direction of different empires palaces.<br><br>Afterward, Kyle looked at the top of Holy Church for while, chuckling he turned his attention towards the top of the Zeroth Organization, after some time Kyle turned back and looked beyond the human continent, he stared intensely in the almost destroyed island direction, and muttered,<br><br>"Interesting, everything changed after two thousand years. Ah! now that I come back I must take things slowly before they show up or I should wrap things up quickly going to them?. Sigh! Back then because I was bored waiting for Emea to completely regains her memories and power, I decided to go explores the vast universe but who would have thought that I would stumble upon a bunch of sneaky rats sniffing around. They were after Emea and others. I scare them away, they will come back for sure. Ah! I just want to live peacefully, that's all.''<br><br>Kyle murmured, then he vanished from where he was and reappears, in a big forest not too far from the Neon empire. He starts slowly walking but then he stopped abruptly and glanced in the direction of the Demon Continent.<br><br>His gaze pierced through their Forbidden Zone and entered the sealed miniature world. This mini world is almost barren with the exception of a white tower and a giant black cube seems to contain something sealed inside. A man dressed in white is floating in the air monitoring the black cube, he has pairs of seven Wings. Kyle chuckled,<br><br>''So they sealed you there old friend, let me give you a little helping hand.''<br><br>Kyle's crimson eyes look at the hovering figure before the latter puked blood, his lack of concentration caused a crack to start to appear on the black cube. The hovering figure looks in Kyle's direction, but he's not that powerful to kill the one that did that to him. He can only swallow his anger. 'You will pay for this Prime'.<br><br>After doing that little mischief on Razael, Kyle starts flying toward the sky, once at seventy meters in the air, he looks in the direction of the vast sea, his crimson eyes pierced through space arriving beyond the sea. He saw an island, a big palace, in the throne room, sat a figure, handsome features Dark hair, a pair of curved horns on each side of his head. On his left was a person looking like he was shrouded with the elements (water, fire, wind,..) strangely these elements seem in harmony with each other.<br><br>The figure on the throne looks in Kyle's direction with his golden vertical pupils like eyes (slightly tainted in black), instantly the world shook once again, this time it was because two powerful individual clashes using their eyes alone. The figure on the throne muttered something to Kyle.<br><br>When Kyle remembered what that person with the golden eyes vertical pupils had murmured, he smiled: ' Welcome back. Enjoy the little time you've before they come.'<br><br>''Hey, Interesting, So, it was your doing. What happened to you Aatox? To think that Aatox would become this powerful and he would do something like that, he seems he didn't know they had come already and that I chased them back,. Sign! I must quickly heal if not. Ah! forget it, first I must go to the academy.''<br><br>Kyle says before starting to walk in the direction of the Neon Empire where the Heaven Manor academy was, where Emea and others are.<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>Fourth Heaven, Blood-Feather City.<br><br>"Brothers, Celestial Ascension is a terrible scam," said a 14-year-old looking boy that sat crossed-legged in a circle alongside 11 men of various ages. With short, neatly combed black hair, thin eyebrows and a friendly gaze, the boy would have looked handsome and harmless if not for the double pupils in his golden, left eye. To avoid attracting the divine bullies, he hid it behind an eyepatch. And like the 11 others, wore a white Taoist robe.<br><br>"Cleanse your body to achieve Purification. Cleanse your soul to achieve Sanctification. Find your Dao Truth, reject your Dao Truth. Cross the Nine Calamities, refine your Celestial Nature and ride the Auspicious Clouds to ascend to Heaven. This is the road mortals call Ascension. Because we all went through it, we understand, we understand…" the teenage-looking boy's eyelids twitched and, with his fists balled up, he threw his head back—roaring at the ceiling, "…that it is a pile of shit!"<br><br>"They tell you that you will be venerated as an immortal, ranking among celestials, and attending the God Empress' Peach Banquets! But once you arrive, from the top of your mortal world, you become the lowest of the low! The pig that even floor sweepers can slaughter! And of course, no damn peach!" The teenage-looking boy sobbed, his words making the 11 celestials beside him break into tears.<br><br>"I started cultivating at 13, reached the first level of Purification at 16, the Hallowed Realm at 22, Daoist at 33, Nihility at 66, Crossed Vicissitudes at 108 and ascended to Celestial Kin at 163!<br><br>Genius! Adored by millions, cursed by billions! More food and wine than I could digest! And I left all that behind to come sweep the floor in Heaven!" Harun, the boy celestial, squealed full of grief.<br><br>Like the others, Harun was born in a Mortal World—the Noxious Flame World in his case. And after 150 years of cultivation, he ascended to Heaven. In his homeworld, he started out as an average child looked down on because of his low talent and unusual left eye. Aware of his own shortcomings, Harun put in five times his peers' work but still took three years to reach the first level of Purification.<br><br>Fortunately, the heavens wouldn't abuse a diligent man. The first level of the Purification Realm unlocked Harun's left eye, the Eye of Luminous Treasures, enabling him to locate the treasures and chances scattered in his homeworld. Harun thus set on a legendary path, broke all records of his world, and became a celestial.<br><br>As he didn't want to be fettered by gold diggers, despite all the princesses and saintesses he dallied with, Harun didn't leave any wife or child behind, and triumphantly rose to Heaven.<br><br>Or so it should have been. But the story refused to take that turn.<br><br>Harun didn't expect that despite ascending on Golden Clouds—the highest attainment for a mortal cultivator—no one would respect his achievements. After asking him a few casual questions, the registrar assigned him the job of page, an official position of the ninth rank no better than a floor sweeper.<br><br>Worse, they downgraded his Celestial Nature from a mighty World-Devouring Serpent to a tiny green viper! Just because the Devouring Serpent was reserved for some divine clan, he went from an all-dominating, ovaries-squeaking reptile to an ordinary snake. Who could bear that shame?<br><br>Enraged, Harun fought for his rights. But it seemed his luck expired in Heaven as, at the first protest, the registrar had him flogged 120 times. Aggrieved, poor Harun sought a judge and was flogged another 80 times.<br><br>Without recourse, he could only accept his fate and start delivering messages for conceited officials while slowly planning his comeback. It'd now been two years since Harun arrived in Heaven, and to cope with depression, he started attending group therapy meetings with celestials in the same pit as him.<br><br>"I was the supreme emperor of my world, a phoenix, downgraded to a pigeon."<br><br>"A black dragon, downgraded to a lizard!"<br><br>"A flood dragon, downgraded to a fish!"<br><br>"Here newborns start at the first level of the Celestial Kin Realm, born celestials. How can they not look down on us? They disdain our treasures, trample our dignity, and the worse of it all is that the God Emperor passed a Divine Law forbidding murder and suicide!"<br><br>"As long as the God Emperor breathes, we must endure! Endure till the word "enduring" is written all over our stomped faces and buttocks!"<br><br>"But how can he die?" Several celestials sobbed with outrage written all over their faces. Unlike Harun, most of these people had been trapped in Heaven for decades or centuries—when they realized that they couldn't return home before reaching the Heavenly God Realm, they all lost hope.<br><br>At that time, the door flew open. Alarmed, the celestials all choked on their treasonous words, fearing that a bored superior spied on their meeting. Faster than the others, Harun had already turned into a snake and hid behind his peers.<br><br>"The God Emperor is dead!" The new entrant, another ninth-rank official, exclaimed with exceptional delight.<br><br>"Hahahaha! The God Emperor is dead!"<br><br>In the Divine Harem, "The old goat is gone!"<br><br>In the Heavenly Court, "Hahaha! Finally, that imperishable son of a bitch is dead!"<br><br>"Praise the glorious heavens! The Emperor is dead!"<br><br>On the 10,000 Mortal Worlds:<br><br>"Why is the breeze so fresh, the sky so clear, and the sun so bright today?"<br><br>"Look at all those rainbows, the Auspicious Clouds, the flying cranes and swans, something great must have happened in Heaven."<br><br>After a reign of nine Cosmic Cycles, or 1,166,400 years, Agiri, the third God Emperor, collapsed under a Cosmic Tribulation—forever erased from the multiverse. His death threw the Heavens into an unprecedented wave of euphoria. From his children to ancient officials, none mourned him.<br><br>But while Harun's peers leaped and danced across the room, throwing scrolls into the air like unruly middle graders, he alone found the news disturbing.<br><br>"Dumbos. Heaven's Throne has no heir. How is this cause for celebration? When the civil war begins, we won't even cut it as meat shields."<br><br>Leaving his fellow celestials behind, Harun sneaked out of the gathering room to return to his chambers. On the road, conflicting thoughts clashed in his mind. Initially a just and beloved monarch, past his eighth Cosmic Tribulation, Agiri went mad. From then on, he promulgated a succession of absurd Divine Laws that shoveled the 33 Heavens into chaos.<br><br>The Right of the First Night, giving him the right to sleep with new brides or concubines on the wedding night.<br><br>The Bleeding Crown Law, forcing high-ranking officials to wear crowns of thorns.<br><br>The two Anti-Death Laws, preventing celestials from committing suicide or murder.<br><br>The Imperial Curbing Law, that forced all imperial princes and kinsmen into house arrest.<br><br>The Divine Right Law, that downgraded the Celestial Nature of the newly ascended celestials, and two others.<br><br>Paranoid, insane, but unrivaled, as the only Dao Emperor of the 33 Heavens, Agiri could do as he pleased and was seen as the chief driver of all the resentment and enmity swelling in this vast realm. With his death, all Divine Laws lost effect, returning freedom to the 33 Heavens' countless lives.<br><br>What a false sense of freedom.<br><br>Believing that his reign would outlast the stars, Agiri never set up a crown prince. Thus, his seven sons, his brothers and surviving uncles, all had strong claims to the throne and wouldn't let go of the chance to become the new Master of Heaven and Earth. In that mayhem, how many would fall to stray bullets, Harun wondered.<br><br>But as his thoughts strayed, "Isn't this our most venerated celestial pipsqueak?" A white-robbed youth, too generic for a full description, blocked his path. Four mook goons stood beside him, and together, they surrounded Harun. Forced out of his thoughts, Harun took a casual glance at the five youths, stopping on the band's leader.<br><br>"Dilsad?" Harun dug the name out of his immortal memories. Dilsad was the nephew of Blood-Feather City's registrar, who recorded the names of all celestials that ascended to the Fourth Heaven and assigned them various ninth-rank positions. A registrar was just an eighth-rank official, but his position gave him tremendous power over the newly ascended celestials. Among them, few dared offend him.<br><br>Dilsad, however, was a nobody. The only reason why Harun remembered him was that he was present during his "welcome party." Since then, the two had never exchanged a word, not even the basic "screw your ancestors." Why was he blocking him?<br><br>"Although the God Emperor just died, his death has already triggered many changes. The God Empress will hold the Peach Banquet early, and our magistrate decreed that all pages must gather in his office tomorrow. Six will be selected to serve in the God Empress' upcoming Peach Banquet. But truth be told, there's no way for a mortal-born celestial like you to attend that gathering. I'm here to tell you to not waste your time. Don't try to look beyond what your eyes can see and accept your lot in life," Dilsad said with a broad grin, proud and elated.<br><br>His cultivation had just broken through to the second level of the Celestial Kin Realm, putting him far above the newly promoted celestials. Like the majority of heaven-born scions, Dilsad despised the newcomers—it was time to bully. And seeing Harun struck speechless, Dilsad stuck his chest out, unleashing the pressure of his cultivation base, intent on suppressing his prey.<br><br>"Even if you resent me, I must do my good deed of the day. I know you must have been some big shot in your homeworld, but here, people like you are as common as the clouds. Toss a stone into the street, and you can hit 1,000. Look at me, my talent is just okay, but I've already reached the second level of the Celestial Kin Realm. You have no merit to speak of and must try hard to prog-"<br><br>With an upward kick, Harun smashed Dilsad's nuts. A cool breeze swept the scene, the pressure of Dilsad's cultivation base collapsed, his jaw dropped, and his eyes went bloodshot.<br><br>In a flash, Dilsad felt the world around him spin. His legs gave out, all strength left his body, and he fell face-first.<br><br>"Argh...argh...aaargh!" Dilsad howled in agony. And though without strength, his hands subconsciously reached for his nuts. Harun wouldn't have it, and blocked Dilsad's nuts under his right foot.<br><br>With an angelic smile, the 14-year-old looking celestial leaned over and said, "Don't misunderstand, I'm trying to help you. Even if you resent me, I must do my good deed of the day." Dilsad had barely registered the words that Harun pulled out a dark-green pill from his cosmic pouch and forced it down his throat.<br><br>As the pill dissolved in his body, Dilsad's skin turned blue, and the damage in his groins intensified till his nuts turned into dust.<br><br>Right, he now had nothing to hold on. Dilsad's pain slowly subsided, but no joy appeared in his eyes.<br><br>"Impossible. Impossible! You didn't...you can't...how? Give me back my balls!" The celestial neared madness. He'd just turned 120 and had yet to rob his first kiss that his balls went missing. Who could bear such a fate?<br><br>Taking his foot off the empty crotch, Harun sighed and replied:<br><br>"So sad. This is a lesson they don't teach you in celestial kindergarten right? Even if you cultivate the Unbreakable Diamond Physique, your balls are still balls. Anyone can crack them. But don't worry, if you stay home for one week and sincerely repent, they might just return. If you seek your uncle, you will die today. Your choice. As an elder, I'm just trying to help you avoid an early death."<br><br>That said, Harun left the scene, and too startled by their boss' fate, the mook goons dared not pursue him.<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>Within a desolate canyon, grays of every shade covered the sky, while the overwhelming stench of blood and the sound of shrieks took over the barren land.<br><br>There was a teenager lying on the ground in a pool of blood. He sneakily turned to the corpse that was next to him, wiped the fresh blood that was trickling out of it onto his face, and lay on the floor straight, pretending he was dead.<br><br>"The people here really do not value their lives, huh?" He opened his eyes slightly, watching the intense battle taking place in front of him. He had a beautiful face, and paired with his long ponytail, he looked slightly feminine.<br><br>Some distance away, a sword light struck the ground, chopping a number of people in half in an instant.<br><br>A gigantic pitch-black beast covered in scales came into his vision stamping its foot heavily, causing the ground to shake. This is a living hell.<br><br>"Oh mother, I want to go home!" the teenager, Lin Fan, wailed.<br><br>Lin Fan had no idea how he got here. Three days ago, he was still gaming at home comfortably, and he fell asleep soon after. When he woke up, he was right here in this unfamiliar environment.<br><br>Shortly after he woke up, memories not belonging to him filled his mind.<br><br>The body that Lin Fan was in now belonged to another guy who had the same name, looks, and even birthmark as him. This information threw Lin Fan off his feet. What on earth is going on?<br><br>And he was currently at a place called the Magnificent Flame Sect, just like the one he read about in a novel.<br><br>The Magnificent Flame Sect was established a hundred and thirty years ago by the mighty Emperor Yanhua, who led his unyielding citizens in overthrowing the brutal tyrant and building up a nation of hope.<br><br>However, it was a pity that the sect was too weak, which made them the prey of many other sects who had been eyeing their fortune. Thus, the sect suffered from constant invasion.<br><br>This was none of Lin Fan's business in the past, but now, it was. He was utterly shocked upon realizing the situation he was in.<br><br>Lin Fan was currently a disciple of the Magnificent Flame Sect that was part of the army. Three days after he found himself in this new body, he would have to leave for the battle against the invaders.<br><br>As soon as he heard the news, Lin Fan attempted to escape numerous times, but it was to no avail. The sect was heavily guarded, making it impossible for him to do so. Therefore, he was now right here, lying in the middle of the battlefield pretending he was dead, with the hope of surviving the bloody war taking place right in front of his eyes.<br><br>"Mamma mia, please, wake me up from this nightmare!" Lin Fan muttered, shaking with fear.<br><br>If you really insist on transmigrating me, then at least bring me to a decent place! What is this!? Is this a joke?!<br><br>A figure could be seen walking over before crashing onto Lin Fan.<br><br>"You're pretending to be dead." The figure looked at Lin Fan. His face was as pale as a sheet of paper and there was blood spurting out of his chest. However, compared to the horn shooting out of his forehead, the huge amount of blood was nothing scary to Lin Fan. What on earth? Is this even a human being?<br><br>"Brother," Lin Fan called out softly. "Can we take a rest? Look at the blood on your chest. It's better if we rest here until the end."<br><br>Oh my, did he agree just like that? Lin Fan stared at him, unable to believe his ears, while the other party turned around and lay next to him. "It's such a great day though…"<br><br>The next second, a sword pierced through his heart. Lin Fan had murdered him with the sword lying by his side.<br><br>The man with a silver horn on his forehead turned to Lin Fan in disbelief. He let go of the weapon that he was gripping onto tightly with his hand and breathed out a word; "Hey!"<br><br>"I'm not stupid. It's obvious that you were trying to kill me too." Lin Fan had never killed a person, but being transported into this messy world, he had no other choice but to kill unless he wished to be stabbed to death.<br><br>The memory of the other "Lin Fan" left him with the knowledge that he should attack if he wished to survive.<br><br>Lin Fan immediately got back to pretending to be a corpse within no time.<br><br>"Oh my god. How do I survive this?"<br><br>"You have slain a Body Tempering Stage Three living spirit. You have gained 30 points."<br><br>"Who are you!?" A voice rang in Lin Fan's head, making him jump up in shock before lying back down within the blink of an eye. If not for the intense battle taking place around Lin Fan, he would have stood up to get himself an answer.<br><br>Shortly, he heard the voice ringing across his head once again.<br><br>"Cultivation: Body Tempering Stage One (+).<br><br>"Rewarded with a ticket for the Epic draw."<br><br>Lin Fan could see a wheel covered with different images in his mind. It started spinning on its own at lighting speed, leaving Lin Fan to be confused about the current situation.<br><br>I do not know what this is, but it's dope! Thankfully, Lin Fan was able to adapt to changes quickly.<br><br>"You've received an Epic level buff: Immortality.<br><br>"Immortality: You will not perish even if the world does (Takes 10 seconds to revive)."<br><br>Lin Fan could feel a slight change taking place in his body. There seemed to be an unknown current of energy flowing through his body.<br><br>"What's going on?" He blinked his eyes, extremely confused. This makes no sense. Immortality?<br><br>Does that mean what I think it means?<br><br>"Oh? What's that spot in the sky? Am I going to wake up?" Lin Fan stared at the bright spot shining brightly in the middle of the sky, which was getting bigger in size as time passed.<br><br>When the spot got close enough, Lin Fan's heart stopped. Oh my god. What kind of evil is this? I did nothing other than lie here, minding my own business, yet I could get shot while lying down? Such luck!<br><br>An ice-cold blade pierced through Lin Fan's body mercilessly. Am I going to die? Lin Fan stared at the sky in despair.<br><br>"Eh, I'm alive again?" Lin Fan opened up his eyes. He could see a sword piercing through his body. Lin Fan did not feel even slight pain, and surprisingly, his mind was clear. Lin Fan grabbed the hilt tightly and pulled the sword out of his body. <br><br>Bright red blood spurted all around the place, but Lin Fan wasn't even slightly hurt as the injury healed within no time.<br><br>Lin Fan jumped up in excitement. Immortality must be real, huh?<br><br>Suddenly, a figure dropped down right in front of Lin Fan.<br><br>"No… I must persevere." The person tried to help himself up, gripping a purple ball tightly while his sight was fixed on the battle that was taking place a distance away, where a gigantic beast had just slaughtered a few comrades without blinking an eye.<br><br>Lin Fan turned to the obese man. The memories that he had obtained from this new body provided him with the information about the man's background: an extremely hard-working and quiet man. He was currently on the ground, holding onto his belly where blood was flowing out constantly, and he was as pale as a sheet of paper. He must have been injured on his belly.<br><br>"Hey fatty, pretend to be dead or else you really will be," Lin Fan whispered.<br><br>The obese man turned to Lin Fan, slightly shocked that Lin Fan wasn't dead. Anger soon took over as he tried to lash out at Lin Fan, but he was too drained to do so, thus he ended up just glaring at Lin Fan with fury.<br><br>"No, I need to send that beast to hell. If they manage to break through, our family and friends will die or be turned into servants at their hands," Lu Qiming growled at Lin Fan.<br><br>Wow, where did he get the energy to yell at me? Lin Fan stared at him, jaw wide open.<br><br>"You can't be a coward! If everyone was like you, then the sect would be doomed! Our future would be ruined, and our descendants would become slaves to them!"<br><br>Lin Fan stared at the obese man clutching his belly right in front of him blankly. He indeed does not speak much, but he sure is righteous.<br><br>To Lin Fan's surprise, the obese man tried to stand up. However, he could not because of the fresh blood that was gushing out of his belly, painting the ground bright red, and he fell down once again.<br><br>Unwillingness and despair could be seen from Lu Qiming's eyes as he shut them slowly.<br><br>Out of nowhere, he felt someone trying to take away the purple ball in his hand.<br><br>Lu Qiming opened his eyes in shock.<br><br>"You're right. If I don't do this, who will? Just hand this matter to me. If I do not come back, remember to burn incense paper for me yearly."<br><br>All Lin Fan hoped to do was leave this place right away. What does your battle have to do with me?<br><br>And with my immortality, I can go anywhere I want to in this world.<br><br>This world had caught Lin Fan's interest. Of course, he would not have paid any attention if he did not have the buff.<br><br>"You…" Lu Qiming stared at Lin Fan in shock. Never would he have thought that this comrade of his would be so brave.<br><br>Lin Fan stared at him with determination. "The wind will blow and the stream will flow, but a hero will go and never come back. I'll leave now. Live on with my determination."<br><br>Lu Qiming's face turned even redder as Lin Fan's words rang in his mind.<br><br>Tears flowed down his cheek as Lu Qiming shouted at the figure dashing to the battlefield. "You must survive."<br><br>Lin Fan did not even bother to turn back as he continued dashing forward.<br><br>"Survive? What nonsense, I'm getting out of here."<br><br>As Lin Fan got closer, he realized that the gigantic beast was not that enormous, but it resembled Godzilla.<br><br>Lu Qiming sat on the floor, staring at the figure that was now far away.<br><br>It was impossible to destroy the beast, but Lu Qiming still kept his hopes high.<br><br>All of a sudden, the figure that Lu Qiming was following dropped to the ground. Due to it being too far away, Lu Qiming could not tell what happened to Lin Fan.<br><br>"No…!" Lu Qiming wailed. But the next second, something unbelievable happened; that figure that dropped down stood up.<br><br>Perhaps it was Lu Qiming's imagination, but the figure's back was covered in blood.<br><br>"Darn it. Why are those idiots chopping me? A crowd will always bring trouble," Lin Fan muttered. Somebody chopped him in his back when he wasn't paying attention. Luckily this immortality works and revived me after ten seconds.<br><br>He thought no more and started running off.<br><br>Not long later, somebody killed him again. The other party slashed his neck. Lin Fan could not feel the pain, but he could see the blood gushing out of his neck and splashing onto his face.<br><br>Seeing the figure far away dropping down once again, Lu Qiming felt that his world was coming to an end, but to his surprise, the figure stood up after a few seconds and started running toward the gigantic beast.<br><br>Lu Qiming clenched his fist tightly – so tightly that fingernail marks formed on his hand. He was sobbing badly, touched by Lin Fan's act that he perceived to be of perseverance and bravery.<br><br>How brave and how strong must his will be?<br><br>Lu Qiming gritted his teeth and made a promise to himself. "I'll do my best to pass down your spirit."<br><br>On his way, Lin Fan lost count of the number of times that he had died, but thankfully, he managed to revive every time.<br><br>Even with immortality though, they keep killing me as they wish.<br><br>Suddenly, Lin Fan thought of an idea. He stuck closely to the ground and wiggled his way to the beast slowly.<br><br>The battleground gained an earthworm.<br><br>The crowd was in an intense battle, so nobody noticed the earthworm wiggling around.<br><br>"Ah-ha, this is better. I'll stop getting killed." Lin Fan smiled proudly. I'm so smart.<br><br>Not long later, Lin Fan looked up to see the gigantic beast standing right in front of him.<br><br>It was a scary beast that killed many with just a stomp.<br><br>There were four figures floating next to the beast. They were staring into space, as if the battle had nothing to do with them.<br><br>Lin Fan crawled his way to the beast. Even now, there was nobody who took notice of Lin Fan, including the four figures floating next to the beast. They did not even take a look at the ground, as the enemies on the ground wouldn't be worth them worrying over.<br><br>Suddenly, the gigantic beast stomped on the ground. Lin Fan managed to escape its attack, but it was still so strong that it sent Lin Fan flying off, puking blood.<br><br>Lin Fan cursed. "Darn it."<br><br>When he revived once again, he rushed to catch up with the beast.<br><br>The ball he had was a weapon of the Magnificent Flame Sect. It was a Mortal high-class support tool painstakingly made by their tool-refining masters.<br><br>It was designed to assist the Divine Cannon in aiming correctly at its target.<br><br>Lin Fan stood in between the beast's legs and held the ball high. He took in a deep breath and pressed the "on" button before shouting a touching sentence that he saw elsewhere.<br><br>He was so loud that the whole battlefield heard him.<br><br>The great force of the cannon shot straight to the sky.<br><br>"Oh my god, they don't even hesitate, huh?" Even though I have immortality, I do not want to be bombed into pieces!<br><br>"Aish, run!" Lin Fan ran away from the battlefield before the shot landed.<br><br>Lu Qiming, who was lying on the ground in despair, looked up in shock.<br><br>Lu Qiming could no longer hold in his tears, and they gushed out like a waterfall.<br><br>"I'll remember you for life!"<br><br>Lin Fan's action touched all the Magnificent Flame Sect disciples, inspiring them to win the war.<br><br>"How can this be?" The four figures floating next to the beast could not believe their eyes as they were sent flying in an instant.<br><br>The ground shook violently.<br><br>A strong force could be felt across the battlefield.<br><br>Lin Fan might have run quite far, but he did not escape the strong shockwave that came right after him and sent him into the air.<br><br>CREATORS' THOUGHTS<br><br>xiiannie xiiannie<br><br>From 15 Feb 2020, Coins spent on books that aren't selected will be refunded within 30 days.

		chapter: `<br><br>"Taking your previous profession into account, we decided to assign you to a single cell," the chief warden was saying, leading a poker-faced young man down a high-ceilinged corridor, with an armed guard bringing up the rear.<br><br>His voice echoed in the cavernous space along with his and the guard's footsteps, so loud that no one noticed the fact that the prisoner was not making any sound at all. "You can say it's a special consideration for your services, but to be honest, it's just safe for everyone that way." <br><br>The chief stopped in front of a cell and turned to face the handcuffed young man, who slowly looked up at him. "Li Wuxing," the chief said and paused for a few seconds to make sure he had the prisoner's whole attention. "You are no longer an officer of the Seven Stars Special Forces. This is the Alpha Sector of the High-Security Prison of Badu Island, and from now on, you are prisoner number 42960. Do you understand?"<br><br>Li Wuxing did not respond and simply looked back at the chief, his face still an expressionless mask. The prison guard took this as an offence and grabbed his baton threateningly. <br><br>"It's fine," the chief said, putting up a hand to stop the guard. He studied Li Wuxing with pity; anyone who had lost everything in the span of a single night would look as bedraggled as the young man did, in spite of his attempt at putting up a brave face. But the kindest thing the chief could do now is to quell any ideas or hope of escape.<br><br>"Prisoner Li, I hope you won't give us any trouble while you're here," the chief said, part friendly advice, part warning. "As long as you behave, you will have an easy time of it." As easy a time as one could get in a place infamously known as the Devil's Den anyway, the chief thought.<br><br>Li Wuxing still didn't respond, but the chief didn't expect him to. He patted the poor lad on the shoulder and then signalled the guard to lead Li inside. <br><br>The bars clanged shut with finality, and Li Wuxing watched the chief warden and the guard leave. He didn't move until their heavy footsteps faded, and then he turned around to look at his surroundings.<br><br>It was a small cell, just roughly eight square meters of dank space. There was a single bed by the wall and a toilet and sink in the corner. He placed his knapsack on the bed and approached the sink.<br><br>He stared at the haggard face looking back at him in the mirror. With bags under his narrow-set azure eyes and three days worth of facial hair, he looked like he had aged ten years overnight. His cheekbones jutted out on his square face more prominently than usual, and his coal-black hair was a mess.<br><br>Although he hadn't slept for over thirty hours, his eyes were focused and alert, as befitting an officer. He took off his new prison shirt, muscles rippling as he stretched out his arms and broad shoulders.<br><br>Li Wuxing stared at himself in the mirror once again, and for the first time felt something akin to despair. "Fuck...Is this how my life will end? Sentenced for life in a high-security prison?" he cursed under his breath as he sat on the bed and rubbed his hands over his face. He tried to recall what happened in the last two days, piecing together the events that led him into this hellhole.<br><br>Everything started on his twenty-second birthday two days ago. Wuxing normally didn't like celebrating his own birthday, but his squad completed a well-paid mission that day so he decided to throw a party as a reward.<br><br>He was also in a good mood because he would officially become a one-star captain when they returned to headquarters. This promotion meant he would be able to take more high-risk missions, which would earn him more contribution points and allow him to advance faster in the ranks.<br><br>Wuxing never drank alcohol even off-duty, but that night his teammates kept trying to make him drink. He didn't find it suspicious because they did that stunt all the time whenever they were out for a drink and liked teasing him about it.<br><br>He was trained to detect normal sleeping pills, so he could only assume that they used an odourless, tasteless sleeping powder on his soft drink — something that he hadn't encountered before. The sudden drowsiness caught him off-guard, and he could barely manage a word as he fought for consciousness.<br><br>Rui Feng, his right-hand man, sighed and crouched down to look at Wuxing with pity. "Because...you are so damn perfect," Feng said, slowly emphasizing the last three words. "...boss," he added as an afterthought. "Look...you're only twenty-two, and they're already promoting you to one-star captain. Don't you think that's a little too fast?" <br><br>Feng straightened up and averted his eyes as Wuxing tried unsuccessfully to steady himself against the bar counter. "Yes, we were promised promotion for this job. Officer rank," Feng admitted, although Wuxing didn't ask. "We don't expect you to understand since you climb the ranks easily enough. But we would be stupid not to accept this kind of offer."<br><br>"Who?" Wuxing demanded with a growl, but the spurt of energy that came with his anger was short-lived and he collapsed to the ground.<br><br>"It was General Long. His son would be demoted to officer rank when you get promoted, so, of course, he didn't want that to happen," Feng answered candidly, which surprised Wuxing in spite of the fog in his brain. Later, Wuxing would realize it wasn't pity or guilt that made Feng confess — it was only because he didn't expect Wuxing to ever get out of prison that he felt it safe enough to tell him everything. <br><br>"There were many others who were involved. Those who were threatened by your achievements. Major Mu, Major Gong…"<br><br>But Wuxing didn't hear the rest as he finally lost consciousness and succumbed to the darkness.<br><br>Wuxing woke up sputtering as cold water was poured on his head. He found himself tied to a chair in the interrogation room. A bright lamp light was pointed at his face, which disoriented him further.<br><br>He was treated exactly like the criminals he used to apprehend — he was interrogated in extreme conditions for over twenty hours, with only short breaks to give him water. They tried to make him plead guilty, but in the end they couldn't make him utter a single word to incriminate himself.<br><br>So they produced evidence of his crime — photos of him lying drunk on the ground next to a bottle of whiskey and the lifeless body of a young woman whom he hadn't seen before that moment. They claimed that she was killed with his gun, as indicated by the recovered bullet that matched the ones in his pistol and the traces of gunpowder on his hand when he was arrested.<br><br>Even if he were to claim that he was innocent, Wuxing knew that the evidence was enough to find him guilty in every court.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, Wuxing was convicted of first-degree murder by a private judge without any witnesses. The next day, he was transported to Badu Island — to the highest-security prison in the United Nations' Confederation territory, called by many as the "Devil's Den", where only criminals with life sentences were incarcerated.<br><br>"Fuck, fuck, fuck…" Wuxing cursed repeatedly under his breath. He couldn't believe he was done in by them so easily...by people he trusted with his life.<br><br>Trust. Maybe that was the problem. It was his fault that he trusted and got betrayed. He thought of the woman he idolized, General Crimson Devil — a lone wolf who liked to work on missions alone.<br><br>Promoted to general rank at age twenty-five, Crimson Devil didn't have a team but cleared all missions by herself with one hundred percent success rate and perfect marks. Even Wuxing's own record — already considered outstanding with ninety-five percent success rate while working with a team — could not compare.

		chapter: `<br><br>Sand mixed with dust flew everywhere like formless clouds, consequently blinding Liu Xuefeng's vision as he was falling off the cliff. Adrenaline pumped in his system, making him hear nothing but vacuum after that one last cry of horror at his imminent death. However, in spite of his situation, his face was a serene mask – as tranquil as a lake. <br><br>He feared, and yet, he did not. It was as if he had given up from that very moment the ground had given in from under his feet and gravity pulled him mercilessly towards his end. But, if there was one thing his heart ached from, it would be his regrets.<br><br>He was only sixteen. His life was just getting started. It was a pity it would have to end this way.<br><br>Grits that broke off from the debris showered on his face, making him flinch. Along with it came memories. The pieces of rubble that went past created a mirage – a kaleidoscope of recollections.<br><br>Was this that infamous "life review"– the phenomenon widely reported in which a person rapidly saw much or the totality of their life history before they perish? Xuefeng wanted to know. For now, as he plunged towards the bottom, he started seeing the summary of his life flash before his eyes.<br><br>He hailed from a small city around a hundred kilometers away from Shanghai. It was where he was born and had spent all his life.<br><br>At first glance, he wasn't any different from other teenagers his age. He was a very average-looking boy, neither on the bad side nor good looking enough for girls to swoon over. If he could list some things he had an advantage over others though, it would be his knowledge and skills in sports as he's a certified sports addict, and that he was also book smart.<br><br>As if fate was teasing him, his earlier memories flashed in an instant but lingered in the last year of his existence. It was that time when he first learned how to like someone…<br><br>There was one particular girl in his class that he had a crush on: Xiao Tianshi.<br><br>Xiao Tianshi was their well-liked class president – the prettiest girl in the class. It could also be said that she's the prettiest one at school, although there was competition for this title. But for him, she was the most beautiful – like a goddess.<br><br>As he was blessed with the smarts and he was naturally kind towards others, it wasn't very difficult for him to get friends. It a no-brainer that he'd also get close to his crush, as it was he who always gave her a hand whenever she had trouble understanding the lessons and often helped her with her homework. Even though he did only this much with her during their first year of high school, he couldn't be more content.<br><br>However, eventually, something that started off so casually evolved into something more. The connection was there: on the way they talked, on how they treated each other. The awareness they had for each other grew and special feelings began to show – becoming more and more obvious that even the people around them started to notice.<br><br>"Why aren't you guys dating already?" one friend asked one day.<br><br>"You look good together. Why not make it official?" suggested another.<br><br>All of these teasing, Xuefeng didn't mind. In fact, he kind of liked it, most especially when they made Tianshi either blush or avert her eyes, obviously shy. Her shyness was actually one of the traits that he found so endearing about her.<br><br>However, the shy maiden had a secret. She was the daughter of one of the wealthiest men in China. Her mother didn't want her to live her childhood in the spotlight, so she bought a small villa in a remote town and started raising her there from the earliest years. She wanted her daughter to have a normal life.<br><br>Her father didn't agree at first but compromised when his wife promised that he would be the one to decide who their daughter would marry when she turned eighteen.<br><br>This was why, even if the people in the city thought they were slightly rich, they still wouldn't connect them with the Xiao family. This way, Xiao Tianshi could live her childhood quite peacefully, as her mother wished.<br><br>When Liu Xuefeng finally got the courage to ask her out, she didn't want to lie to him anymore.<br><br>"Xuefeng… I'm so sorry. I didn't tell you about this before as I was prohibited. If they find out that I told you, my father would automatically find me a fiancé– and I don't want that."<br><br>She looked totally apologetic that he couldn't say anything back. He didn't know the traditions of the top clans and he couldn't care less about them. But she was important to him, and so, he listened.<br><br>"My father will let me continue to stay here as long as I study well. I like you a lot... but I can't be with you romantically. I don't want to break your heart later on when I'm forced to separate from you."<br><br>By this time, she had looked so sad as if her heart was also breaking from her own words.<br><br>"I wish I was born in a normal family with all the freedom I want, but life chose a different fate for me. I really care about you and I want to continue being around you – studying and joking with you like what we've always done…"<br><br>There was a momentary pause as if she was also absorbing all the things she might lose if her father got wind that she's involved with a boy.<br><br>"Please understand. I don't want to lose you," she told him sincerely. "I wish I could at least try but I have no power in this matter…"<br><br>Liu Xuefeng had nothing to say. He was from an average family and there was no way her father would allow him to date her. Still, he wasn't one to give up so easily and decided to follow her. He believed that with enough hard work and determination, he could change Tianshi's fate.<br><br>He still had that one and only option to study even harder and get into the best university with her. With her father's connections, her place in that school was guaranteed. On the other hand, he would have to be admitted like any commoner. He had little time but that wasn't enough to force him into giving up. Once he became someone huge, her father would look at him differently and he would have a chance to marry her.<br><br>This was how he had it all figured out. But, who would have thought that his plans would be ruined about a month later, during their year-end trip?<br><br>They were supposed to hike in the local mountains with the whole class. Everything went well from morning to afternoon, until they finally had to descend from the hills. Xiao Tianshi wanted to have one last photo with him, so she dragged him towards the cliff, where the scenery was the most picturesque.<br><br>It took her some time to take a perfect photo and when they were finally done, the ground disappeared from under their feet. The part of the cliff they were standing on cracked and split from the rest. There was no time to run, as both of them would feasibly fall. He acted subconsciously and pushed Xiao Tianshi with all his strength to safety.<br><br>But he couldn't do the same for himself.<br><br>Nevertheless, it was alright. This way, at least one person could be saved, and this was what he thought as he heard her scream his name as he fell.<br><br>The cliff was around seventy to a hundred meters high. Although it felt like an eternity that he was even able to summon his memories, it would only really take about four seconds to plunge and hit the ground from that height.<br><br>He closed his eyes getting ready for the impact that would definitely come as he made peace with himself. Under the cliff, the area where he would land was filled with sharp rocks, and one could only imagine the sensation upon slamming against it from above, which he did.<br><br>A grunt escaped his lips upon collision against solid rock, but he barely felt anything.<br><br>"Did I die?" he wondered as his mind checked his body. But there was really no pain. "I probably died instantly, heh," he deduced.<br><br>His eyelids fluttered as he tried to pry open his eyes but couldn't. It was as if they became heavy.<br><br>He was wondering about what to do when he realized something unbelievable.<br><br>The knowledge that he was indeed still able to reason stunned and excited him. Yet, he was also pretty confused. When he was finally able to lift his heavy lids and open his eyes, there was nothing but darkness. It was as if he was in a void – a dark abyss with no one but himself as his companion.<br><br>He had no idea how long he stayed like that, waiting for something, and yet, nothing at the same time. He couldn't even remember if he'd drifted off to sleep at some point. In this dark, hollow world, it was difficult to keep track of time.<br><br>It began with a tiny dot of white – a welcome contrast in the all black world he was trapped in. It seemed to be moving. As it shifted, its size appeared to get bigger and bigger, its shape more and more irregular. It spiraled closer and closer at great speed, and he could only stare at it in caution, curving his body with his arms crossed in front of him, bracing for the impact as the light exploded in brilliance before swallowing him whole.<br><br>Then the scenery shifted. He was up in the air!<br><br>He was suspended above what seemed to be a road that forked into two at the end. He wondered what it was when grey shadows began to appear all around him one after another.<br><br>Liu Xuefeng had never seen anything like those, and so, he stared at them curiously and watched as they soon took on human-like shapes. He noticed then that they were also drifting in the direction where he was heading. It was as if all of them were being pulled by an invisible force.<br><br>He was wondering if he truly had died, when one of those "souls" turned to him and he flinched, startled, upon seeing its hollow face.<br><br>"What's going on?" he asked out loud as soon as he recovered from his fright.<br><br>The "soul" that turned to him resumed its original position, falling in line silently with the rest of its kind, drifting without moving.<br><br>Everywhere he looked were expressionless souls that behaved uniformly without any personality. Regardless of how many times he tried to search around, he couldn't find anyone else who was like him – the only one who seemed to act as if he was still alive.<br><br>Liu Xuefeng tried to stop and go against the flow for a moment, but the power pulling him was too strong to resist.<br><br>It did not take long for him to finally see his destination. He had reached the end where the road was divided into two paths. At the end of each course was a huge gate, one the colour of ebony, the other ivory.<br><br>The gates to either heaven or hell couldn't have been more clichéd.<br><br>Xuefeng craned his neck to see that almost all the souls were flying towards the black gate and only some flew towards the white one.<br><br>Soon, it was almost his turn to step onto one of the paths. He was wondering where he'd end up when suddenly, a golden light flashed in front of him. Stunned, he was temporarily blinded by its radiance. But when he was able to focus again, he was surprised to see a golden ball in front of his face.<br><br>Xuefeng couldn't help but think that the thing was studying him – monitoring his expressions. He tried to turn from it, but as soon as he moved his face away, the sphere would also shift and follow him.<br><br>A little bit annoyed, he extended his hand to touch it or fend it off – he didn't care but was stunned again when his hand just went past through it.<br><br>He stared wide-eyed at the ball, as he felt its warmth in his hand.<br><br>As soon as the question escaped his lips, he heard an emotionless voice inside his head.<br><br>"Come here boy," it commanded, and before he could even act, he was suddenly pulled by a strong force towards the white gates, passing through it in an instant.<br><br>The scenery had changed again. Since he passed through the white gate, he thought that his must be heaven.<br><br>At a distance, he could see a small queue of souls in front of two white-robed men. One was old and the other middle-aged.<br><br>Xuefeng noted that the souls at this place were much brighter than the grey ones flying towards the black gate earlier but none of them had a golden light hovering next to them like him. However, since he had no idea what he was supposed to do or where he was supposed to go, he decided to fall in line.<br><br>Soon, it was his turn. The two men in white robes were surprised upon seeing him.<br><br>"Interesting," the old man muttered almost to himself. "It's been a while since I have seen a fate law choosing someone."<br><br>"He must have accumulated a lot of karma in his past life," the middle-aged man nodded in agreement as he looked at Xuefeng in approval.<br><br>"Fate law?" It was all he could ask. He had no idea what these men were talking about.<br><br>"Boy, as you were chosen by the fate law, we can agree to one of your wishes," the old man informed him but it didn't clear his confusion.<br><br>"Er…" Xuefeng's eyes shifted from one man to another, hoping they would elaborate which they thankfully did.<br><br>"You are currently in a place called Middle Heaven. This is a place where all the souls gather after their physical selves die. After they come here, we split them into two groups: People with positive and the other, people with negative karma."<br><br>The old man raised two fingers indicating the number as he explained.<br><br>"The people with positive karma will have a chance to reincarnate directly. Those with negative ones will have to be judged before we decide if they should reincarnate or perish."<br><br>"Am I… Am I qualified to be reborn?" Xuefeng asked them. If they told him he was somewhat a "chosen one", then it meant his karma was positive, right?<br><br>"Of course," they answered, and he was relieved but not for long.<br><br>There was another question that had been bothering him. "Am I going to forget my memories after my rebirth?"<br><br>This made the men exchange looks before answering him. One even cleared his throat before he spoke. "Normally, before everyone reincarnates, they have to drink a special soup that will make them forget all their memories. But you can make use of your wish and keep them."<br><br>Oh.<br><br>"I wish to keep them," he instantly replied.<br><br>"So fast? Don't you want to think more? You can wish for anything you ever want – anything your heart desires," the old man prompted, urging Xuefeng to consider longer, but there was interest shining within his old pair of eyes.<br><br>But his wish was final, and he shook his head.<br><br>"I don't want to forget her…" he told them just as Xiao Tianshi's face flashed in his mind.<br><br>The old man nodded in understanding.<br><br>"Okay," he agreed. "Your wish shall be granted. But because the amount of memories is too huge, we must reincarnate you as a teenager. Are you alright with that?"<br><br>A teenager? He had already lived for 16 years, so he didn't mind.<br><br>"Sure," he agreed as he remembered another important matter. "I have one more question. Will I be reborn as a human?" he asked to confirm.<br><br>"Of course, or there would be differences in your body otherwise. Unfortunately, we can't get you back to Earth. Because you died, your life link to that world was severed. You can only reincarnate into a different realm. But don't worry, as a fate law holder, we will not mistreat you."<br><br>This time, it was the middle-aged man who answered before he lifted his hand and pointed at something behind him with his thumb. "If you don't have any more questions, you can go through the portal behind us."<br><br>As he didn't have any other inquiry, Liu Xuefeng did as he was told. He took one last good look at his surroundings as he thought of her once more. He had just been told that he no longer had any connections with his previous life. This meant he would never see her again.<br><br>His lids fell half-closed as his eyes glistened with sadness. He took a deep breath and flew towards the portal where he was told to go. As he neared it, the golden light that had been hovering near him all this time, moved quickly and sank into his skull without him noticing, becoming a part of the new him.<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>Fresh stream water gushed out from Xuefeng's throat as they finally reached the shore. Thin but strong arms gripped him in place until he coughed out all the water clogging his lungs. <br><br>"Are you alright?" Tianshi asked worriedly, rubbing his cheek gently. <br><br>She was his wife, the only one who left the passage with him while the rest got lost, separated from them forcefully. <br><br>"I'm fine," Xuefeng said weakly, trying to reassure her. He tried to lift himself up but a throbbing pain flared in his chest, making him flinch. <br><br>Right… Heavenly Chains broke my ribs.<br><br>"Don't move yet. Your wounds are still healing," Tianshi reminded him and forced him to lie down. "Rest for a moment. Rushing won't benefit us right now anyway."<br><br>Xuefeng closed his eyes, seeking comfort from Tianshi's soft touch as she cradled his white-haired head on her lap.<br><br>Suddenly, a sweet voice resounded in his mind, clearly apologetic.<br><br>'I'm sorry for being useless...'<br><br>'It's not your fault, Ling,' Xuefeng said, reaching out for her in his mind. She was one of the two Fate Spirits living inside his body, who had been helping him since the beginning of his journey. Without them he wouldn't have been able to stay alive. How could he blame them for anything? 'I'm the useless one. I should be the one taking care of my wives.' His voice was tinged with bitterness; he still couldn't accept what had happened.<br><br>'Let me heal your wounds,' Ling said softly. Immediately, he felt his bones reconstructing, and then the pain slowly receded.<br><br>'I don't know how this happened,' Ming spoke up with despair. 'If only there was a way for me to help, I could have prevented it..." As Ling's mother, she was supposed to know things that Ling couldn't help him with, yet even her knowledge turned out to be lacking. Even as the former Queen of Heavens, she couldn't influence Heavens' will.<br><br>Xuefeng opened his eyes and looked up at his beautiful wife who called out his name.<br><br>Tianshi's face hovered above his own, water dripping from her wet brown hair. They were both completely drenched, but her crystal blue gaze was full of warmth, her slender fingers rubbing his elvish ears gently to ease his pain. <br><br>He was of the Royal Forest Elf Bloodline, and his lovers could please him with just a soft touch to his ears, but in his current state the gesture barely registered in his mind. <br><br>"Don't blame yourself," Tianshi insisted. "It's not your fault. We will find everyone in no time."<br><br>Xuefeng heard her soothing words but he felt too guilty and ashamed to accept the comfort his wife offered. He felt her cup his face so he would look at her, and when his golden orbs locked with her own he saw that she was smiling.<br><br>"But I failed everyone," he muttered. <br><br>He couldn't protect his wives. <br><br>He couldn't keep his promise. <br><br>Did he even deserve them anymore? <br><br>"No," Tianshi said, shaking her head. "It's everyone's fault. We weren't strong enough to support each other and failed together. It happens to the best. What matters now is how we grow and improve from this. We can only learn by failing." <br><br>She lifted his left arm, showing him the birthday present that he received from them. Nine multi-colored crystals on a string, creating one of a kind bracelet. <br><br>Each crystal beat like a heart, some quicker, other slower than the rest. Each represented one of his wives. The crystals were bathed in their blood and had part of their soul inside of them. As long as the crystals were whole, his wives were safe. <br><br>"We are all alive. That's what's most important," Tianshi added. <br><br>"Ah… you are right," Xuefeng said with a sigh and finally stood up, pulling her up with him. "Let's focus on finding everyone then. I won't be at peace until we are all together." <br><br>Even if he was depressed, there was nothing else he could do now. The longer he stalled, the more chances of his wives getting hurt. <br><br>"Yes!" Tianshi agreed, nodding firmly. "Is your chest alright?" <br><br>"It's fully healed now," Xuefeng replied, pulling up his shirt so they could both inspect it. Thanks to his regeneration ability he only needed a few breaths to recover.<br><br>"I still don't understand, though. Why would Heavens want to split us?" Tianshi questioned, squeezing out water from her hair. "Are there rules preventing groups from entering the Heaven Realm?" <br><br>"There shouldn't be any. It must be something else," Xuefeng replied with a frown. He was confused and completely clueless. <br><br>He couldn't count how many times he had angered or challenged Heavens. <br><br>He dried his clothes in a blink, evaporating the water inside them and Tianshi followed his actions, helping him scan their surroundings. Endless greenery, lush trees, and fields of grass as far as the eye could see, yet his gaze landed on the stream they just got out from. <br><br>The passage from the Earth Realm had thrown them out at the bottom of it.<br><br>After dying on Earth, he reincarnated into the World of Cultivation, the fascinating realm of magic and elements where only one's imagination is the limit, where one could achieve his wildest dreams and reach the top of the world. But it was also a ruthless place, where cultivators fight — and even kill — for resources.<br><br>Despite all that, Xuefeng survived — and flourished. He learned how to battle, how to cultivate his body and soul and climb to the top of the Earth Realm, and even how to love. Aside from Tianshi, his childhood best friend who followed him from his home on Earth, he met his beautiful wives in that new world and trained alongside them. <br><br>He mastered all nine Elements, the crucial part of his Cultivation Path that put him steps ahead of his peers, and finally reached the point of Ascendance to the Heaven Realm. Both Xuefeng and his wives were ready to depart for their new adventure. <br><br>Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned.<br><br>Just as they thought they had succeeded, rushing through the passage between the Realms, they were attacked by the Heavens, forcefully split apart. Even their two Spirit Beasts ascending together with them were not spared. They were ones of the many beasts in the World of Cultivation that could absorb the energy from nature and grow into powerful beings, rivaling humans in their path of cultivation.<br><br>The faces of his crying wives as their hands slipped away from his palms still lingered in his mind. It was a sight that he never wanted to see again.<br><br>"Water Element seems to dominate this area. There are almost no other elements in the air," Tianshi pointed out. <br><br>Xuefeng silently agreed. Aside from the Water Essence in the air, all other elements were barely existent. Even if he tried to absorb the small energy particles of elements in the air, it wouldn't be enough to satisfy his daily needs. <br><br>"I think we are in the Water Element Land. I remember Ming mentioning it before," Xuefeng explained. "There are nine lands in the Heaven Realm and each land represents one element." <br><br>'Ming?' He called out in his mind, requiring more information. <br><br>'We are lucky,' Ming answered. 'Water Element Land is the least harsh one, with the most greenery and wildlife. We even landed in the southern part, which is the easiest one to explore. The northern part would be covered in endless snow and ice.' <br><br>Xuefeng's thoughts instantly wandered to his wives. <br><br>'Does that mean everyone else has to face harsher conditions?' <br><br>'There are no 'good' or 'bad' locations in the Heaven Realm,' Ming explained 'Everywhere is dangerous. Because you can only replenish one element in each Land, the Heaven Realm is hard to live in. I suggest we find a hideout so I can slowly explain everythin—' <br><br>Before Ming could finish speaking, there was an explosion somewhere not far from them. More sounds quickly followed, which to their surprise, were getting louder with each second. <br><br>'They are coming to us!' Ming called out. 'There are more than a hundred of them!' <br><br> Xuefeng and Tianishi turned to look at the horizon in alarm and saw multiple black dots rushing in their direction.<br><br>Golden Wings appeared on Xuefeng's back as he grabbed Tianshi in his arms, getting ready to flee, but she held his arms to stop him. She pointed to the incoming group. <br><br>"Xuefeng, look! They are chasing something!" <br><br>A shiny object seemed to be flying speedily in front of countless cultivators. As they got closer, Xuefeng was able to get a better look at the scene.<br><br>It turned out that the cultivators were after the dark blue ball that was flying away from them. Focused on their target, they weren't being particularly aggressive with each other, except when someone got too close to the ball. Then they attacked him until the ball got away and they resumed the chase.<br><br>Before Xuefeng could decide what to do, the group flew past them. No one in the group even seemed to notice they were there.<br><br>It must have been quite a treasure, Xuefeng thought. He was pondering whether they should join the chase when Ming cried out in his mind.<br><br>'Xuefeng! You need to get it!' <br><br>If Ming got excited over something, it meant it was definitely a precious treasure. Xuefeng didn't hesitate and launched to the sky like a rocket with Tianshi in his arms. Fire blasted from his feet, giving him an additional boost and Tianshi wrapped his body with her Support Arts that sped them up even further. She already got used to flying with him. His Golden Wings were much faster than her own, which were perfect in such a race of speed.<br><br>"Tianshi! Grab it quickly when we'll fly past it!" Xuefeng cried out mid-air. He held her with both arms across her chest and waist so she could be the catcher this time. <br><br>In barely ten seconds, they had caught with the group and flown above everyone else. Xuefeng caught a glimpse of white uniforms with a crest that looked like a light blue bird on the back, but before he could inspect it further, he was already at the front of the pack, chasing the Dark Blue object that was zooming out of reach.<br><br>Curses flew up to them, but Xuefeng ignored them all, closing in on the treasure in a blink of an eye. <br><br>They were just above what the cultivators called a Fragment, ready to catch it, when the ball came to an immediate stop and dove downward. Xuefeng turned sharply, but with his speed, it was impossible to be as nimble as the treasure. <br><br>The cultivators laughed as they followed the fragment, zooming ahead of him. Someone launched forward, gaining the lead in the race.<br><br>Did they really think they could win? <br><br>Everything froze when his newest ability activated. <br><br>He smiled and slowed down, flying calmly in the frozen sky. The faster he moved, the more Fate Qi he had to use to change the time flow of the space in front of him. He could not waste the precious Fate Qi that his Fate Spirits patiently cultivated from his limited stock of Fate Stones.<br><br>If anyone looked closely at the cultivators' bodies, they would notice that they were actually moving, but in very slow motion. In comparison, Xuefeng was like a ghost, passing the sky unnoticed. <br><br>"This is so cool," Tianshi whispered, equally impressed and envious. "This is my first time seeing this. You could have shown it to me earlier." <br><br>"I can't use it for long. It drains too many resources to just activate it," Xuefeng explained. "I hope this is worth it."<br><br>'It is!' Ming called out excitedly just as Tianshi reached out to grab the object that everyone seemed to desire. 'I haven't even told you about them yet, and now you already got your First Water Qi Upgrade Fragment. It hasn't even been ten minutes since we arrived!'<br><br>Tianshi held the Fragment in her hand, and together they looked down at it. It was just a shiny, oval-shaped dark blue rock. "What is this Upgrade Element?" he asked, but then time suddenly returned to normal.<br><br>The group of cultivators unfroze but held still, momentarily confused, and then startled when they saw Xuefeng appear as if teleported. <br><br>"They have the Fragment!" someone in the group called out and, as one, the cultivators turned to look at Tianshi's open palm. <br><br>Previously fighting against each other, the cultivators in white uniforms now turned to Xuefeng and Tianshi as their common enemy. Weapons appeared in their hands, and Xuefeng knew the game was over.<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>Tamaki Hiroto woke up groggily while holding the back of his head. His brain throbbed for a bit as it made him feel slightly weak.<br><br>While it happened, it was as if his head contemplated the recent event that transpired; it was like inserting and playing the scene of someone's memory he didn't know why but somehow he had transmigrated.<br><br>That's right, he died, getting hit by a truck and save a little girl in the process. He thought it was so worth it.<br><br>Hiroto looked at his surroundings. He seems to be in a room. From what he remembers, in the other set memories that were integrated to him, this was his predecessor's room. It was now his room since he had transmigrated to this identity.<br><br>Hiroto sorted the memories his past life experienced and the memories of the body he just transmigrated. It was an assumption based on the novels he had read. But it seems his conclusion was true and that he had traveled across other words. In his heart, he prayed for his predecessor's better luck in his next life.<br><br>That this world's Hiroto had already died from an unexpected tripping accident when he was in his room. It was unlucky of him.<br><br>Considering that they transmigrated him from this body, someone or somehow did it, he felt lucky because of the new chance of life and the dream he always imagined, it was an 'Isekai' transmigration based on the novels he had read. Everything felt real, and this was undisputable based on the memories and the pain he was experiencing.<br><br>'Hiroto from this world was different' he thought while he sorted the memories in his head.<br><br>Hiroto of this world was 16 years old, average looks and build. Living with his parents, his dad working abroad while his mother was working in a nearby city.<br><br>His past life differed from this one, although he was 25 years old there, nothing was similar other than that they were both an Otaku. Though in his past life he was an orphan and working full time but thinking of it doesn't really matter now.<br><br>That's right, this guy was a full member of ACG before and present, hardworking from his past work. Right now a smooch from the parents and the collection of his ACG stash are nearly busting his room cabinets.<br><br>Hiroto thought of the house he was living in, it was a cozy apartment loft, they used the biggest room and it was two floors. It was immaculate to look and for cleaning, his parents hired someone to maintain the other rooms.<br><br>Hiroto had to accept his identity since he would live in this world now. He was still studying. The 16 years old Hiroto would attend a new coed school two weeks from now, it was a new start of school life for him.<br><br>He thought maybe I'll get a girlfriend in this life. In the past because of different work and hobbies, I did not have time for that but now, I want to have one. Though he won't rush anything as he wants to try all stuff.<br><br>Hiroto thought of the anime, manga or games he had watched and played, he assumes that his situation is like transmigration or reincarnation so he thought that he would be placed in a similar fantasy that goes in his head and so he would also have thought of having a system.<br><br>Maybe, every otaku's dream was to have a system after their death or a similar reincarnation tropes that they want to happen for them. Hiroto considered his position right now and felt satisfied with it as with or without, at least he was still given a second chance.<br>The current living of his predecessor was bad and thought he would change it, he would rather not delve about the past and focus on the present now.<br><br>Hiroto opened his computer and power it on, he looked at the information on the internet.<br><br>School Idols?, a Different Entertainment?.<br><br>Hiroto was looking for information on the internet when suddenly.<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>A sudden buzzing noise reverberated through one of the Phoenix University's male dormitory rooms, disrupting the restful morning. The room was compact and tidy, but the air was stale as if no one had opened its sole window for days.<br><br>The buzzing noise came from a nondescript phone vibrating at the top of a nightstand, inevitably annoying to the point of waking the only resident of that unit—'a youthful man' who was sleeping soundly on a bed next to it.<br><br>Unwillingly he sat up and looked around with his groggy eyes to find the source of sound which was preventing him from continuing his beauty sleep. Realizing it was only his phone, his head slumped back onto the pillow. He lazily reached out and turned the alarm off through the side button, intending on going back to sleep again.<br><br>But sadly, it proved to be a futile attempt. His phone vibrated once again, making him realize that it wasn't an alarm, rather a call. He had no choice but to sit up and take the call, given the fact only a few closed ones had his personal phone number. Out of those, his mother was the one.<br><br>Seeing that it was her, he subconsciously fixed his messy brown hair by combing back the scattered strands with his fingers before he accepted the call.<br><br>"Hi, Mom…" he said weakly, his voice was still hoarse from sleep.<br><br>He had no inkling what the call was about, but out of instinct, he pulled the phone away at a safe distance from his ear before his mom could even speak. He could predict what would happen next so he quickly pulled the phone away to save himself from the pain.<br><br>If his mom knew what he was thinking about, she would have smacked him across the head.<br><br>"Ryan! How long do you plan to sleep?! It's past noon already!" His mom shouted. It hit his ears hard, even though he was at a distance.<br><br>"Mom… My classes are late tod—"<br><br>Ryan wanted to respond, but his mom's barrage of words was like firing bullets, not giving him a chance to counter.<br><br>"I don't have time for your excuses! How old Are You? Twenty-three already! You will finish your studies this year, yet you still act like a child. No wonder you have no girlfriend. Why don't you spend more time on—"<br><br>His mother went on scolding him. Even added insult to his injuries by criticizing him upon his current relationship status.<br><br>Despite having cheerful looks, Ryan was single for the reasons even he could not justify. His cute dimples and clear blue eyes were more than sufficient to attract the opposite sex. However, his uncontrollable reaction to them was weird enough to push any sane girl away.<br><br>Being aware of his mother's nagging tendencies, he no longer tried to argue with her, or else he would never get to return back to sleep. This was not the first time he got a call from her with similar concerns anyway.<br><br>"Mom, aside from that, anything important you called for?" Ryan asked, going straight to the point. He was really in the mood to doze off again.<br><br>He expected another barrage of complaints from her, but his mother seemed to be gracious today and ordered, "Quick, check the email I have sent you!"<br><br>"Now?" he replied after a soundless yawn, knowing exactly what answer he would get.<br><br>"Yes! Right now!" his mother shouted back, living to his expectations.<br><br>"Okay, okay, I am doing it now. Give me a second," Ryan calmed her down and immediately put her on speaker while he quickly switched over to his mailbox on the phone. He knew his ears would hate him for that later, but he couldn't get away with it.<br><br>It didn't take him long to spot his mom's email as it was the most recent one in his inbox. He opened it with a tap. To his surprise, it was empty aside from having three files attached to it.<br><br>Each had a different female name. The title of the attachment being: Emma, Jennie, and Lisa.<br><br>Randomly tapping on one of them, it shocked him to discover a picture of a beautiful woman with a detailed personal description of herself. With just a scan, he now knew her measurements, her qualifications, likes, and whatnot. Everything he would want to know about her was there.<br><br>Before he voiced out the inevitable question to his mother, he could not help but check out the other two attachments and observed their similar profiles. What they all had in common was that all three women were varying levels of beauties and had graduated from the best universities in the country.<br><br>Ryan had calmed down, but thinking about it, he still did not get why on earth was she showing those profiles to him so early in the morning. "What are these…?"<br><br>"Did you check the files already? Perfect!" His mom got excited. "Tell mommy which one you choose."<br><br>"Huh? Choose for what?" Ryan got more confused, but then he recovered and laughed instead. "Don't tell me you joined the mafia and I am helping you choose your next target?"<br><br>His mother did not appreciate his sense of humor at all and scolded him at once.<br><br>"Idiot, definitely not! Just pick the one you like the most!"<br><br>"Okay, tell me, is it kidnapping or a simple mobbing? I can't blindly pick anyone like that," Ryan continued to troll her, finding it quite amusing.<br><br>She did not take it well and directly warned, "If you continue to spurt nonsense, I will drive over to your dorm and beat your ass! We are not kidnapping the girls! Those are your girlfriend candidates!"<br><br>"Pfft!" Ryan burst out laughing to the point he would have spilled and choked on water if he was drinking any. It was the last thing he would want his mother to say. Maybe he misheard her? He repeated to confirm, "Girlfriend candidates?"<br><br>He thought she would shout again but his mother called out to him in a sugary sweet voice instead, "Yes, exactly. Your mother took care of everything as she knows you are struggling to find a girlfriend. You are welcome."<br><br>He stopped laughing. All alarms in his brain lit up, instantly alerting of something being wrong.<br><br>His mom was never this sweet to him.<br><br>"I can sense your scheme from a mile away. What are you planning? Who are those girls and why are you suddenly asking me to find a girlfriend?" Ryan questioned, feeling that she was not being honest. There must be some ulterior motives hidden behind this, and the prime reason was not something as simple as wanting his son to have a partner. He gave her an ultimatum. "If you don't tell me, I am hanging up."<br><br>"Wait! Don't!" his mom called out anxiously. "I would tell you anyway after you make your pick. Why are you being so impatient?"<br><br>"Tell me what's going on. I will not pick anyone until you spill the beans," he placed a condition, leaving his no with no other choice.<br><br>"All right, the truth is your grandma called yesterday. She said she will come back to our hometown next week, on Valentine's Day to be exact. She wants to meet all of her grandsons along with their second halves."<br><br>"Your mother, who left ten years ago?" Ryan tried to recall the face of this estranged grandma. "Let me guess, you told her I have a girlfriend. Am I right?"<br><br>He knew his mother well enough to know he had guessed the truth correctly. She also instantly admitted, "I did! Karen already said that both of her boys have wives. How could I say you don't even have a girlfriend after your grandma brought it up?"<br><br>'She would rather jump off the building than to admit aunt got it better.' he thought.<br><br>"Anyway, that's not all. There is a reason she is coming back. She wants to pass on the ownership of her company to one of her grandsons and the meeting next week, will determine who gets it."<br><br>His mom's explanation was explosive news.<br><br>"Wait, what? Really? But doesn't her company deal with cosmetics and fashion? I don't think any of us will be fit to lead it."<br><br>Being in the know about their skills, Ryan knew the company would not do well in either his or his two cousins' hands. He was the youngest amongst the three of them and was studying Business and Management at Phoenix University. He had theoretical knowledge on how to manage a company, but the competitive world of fashion takes special skills to manage.<br><br>About aunt Karen's sons, both led their own various companies, though both in different industries. One dealt with car dealerships, another with real estate. They didn't have the practical skills which were required to thrive in the fashion industry.<br><br>"That's exactly why your grandma wants to see your wives instead! She plans on choosing her successor out of your lovers!" His mom finally revealed the objective of her grandma.<br><br>Listening to it, Ryan shrugged with indifference. "Well, too bad. I don't even have a girlfriend, much less a wife. Seems like I am out of the race."<br><br>His mom was not an amiable person to take his disavow well as she immediately added, "Therefore I am here to help you! We can't let my ugly sister win! I already found you, three decent candidates. You just need to pick one. It shouldn't be that hard, right?"<br><br>Ryan would have been glad to know that his mother wanted to help him. Not only that, she even found gorgeous and highly competent girls. Anyone sane person wouldn't reject them, in short, they all were outstanding… However; he found one major flaw in her plan.<br><br>"Won't I be obliged to live with that girl for the rest of my life then? You expect me to decide on such a big matter merely in a week?? It's not possible, mom."<br><br>Ryan would rather let this opportunity pass than to get stuck with someone he had no feelings for. Who knows what personalities these 'girlfriends candidates' could have?<br><br>His mom did not answer him but tried another antic. She changed her approach, playing on his emotions instead.<br><br>"So you'll give up and let Karen win? Is that how you want to repay me for all those years I've been raising you? Can't you just try meeting any of the girls I asked you? They'll really make a good wife. Maybe you would fall in love at first sight? You shouldn't say no before you even try to meet at least one of them… Please, Ryan, do this for mom."<br><br>"You and your silly competition with Auntie…" With a helpless sigh, Ryan collapsed back on his bed. How could he come up with the heart to reject his mom when she was begging him like that. "Fine, I will give it a try. You won't stop nagging me if I don't anyway. But just know that if I can't like any of them, we are done with this."<br><br>His mother seemed to be satisfied with the response as she quickly exclaimed, "Great! Pick one now and we can meet her tomorrow! I will wait for your call then! If you get to win this, we will be rich!" She couldn't wait to get rich and brag in front of her cousin!<br><br>"Is that so?" Ryan could feel a headache, already regretting that he agreed to it.<br><br>"Of course! Your grandma's brand is one of the best in the world! You wouldn't understand even if I told you, so just know that you have to do your best to grab this golden opportunity. Call me when you have made your choice!" His mom explained further and then immediately hung up on him, not giving him a chance to raise a question anymore.<br><br>"Damn!" Cursed Ryan. "I have always known grandma was rich but 'best in the world' is a whole different level." He suddenly had a bitter feeling for it.<br><br>He barely remembered his grandma's face as it had been a long time since she left Phoenix City. Ten years ago, she left the country with her paltry sum, and now she was suddenly coming back, planning to give her world-class company away. It's such a dramatic turn of events that no one in his family could have ever imagined.<br><br>"I guess this week will be interesting."<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>Under the starry dark sky, in a dreary forest, the sound of something being pulled could be heard. The shadowy figure appeared to be pulling a young average man in his twenties to a cave. The man had small black hair parted to both sides and a pale square-shaped face. His eyes were trembling a little and fully opened up the next instance.<br><br>'Mm, ah where am I?" He surveyed around warily. Discerning the circumstance, he expressed in a worried tone.<br><br>'Agh, what is this?! Why am I wrapped up by a lamia.' He then began to resist frantically to escape from her. Sensing the disturbances, the lamia gazed back,<br><br>"Ara, you have woken up! You were sleeping so peacefully, why did you wake up?" The lamia innocently questioned, from her features, she appeared to be a female with a beautiful oval-shaped face, blue hair, black eyes with a small nose and cherry red lips. Her upper body was lustrously firm, exuding strength with large dumplings on top. She had a blue scale serpentine body for the lower half.<br><br>The man was confused by her question, sweats were covering his face in a rapid pace.<br><br>"I got captured by some unknown nymph, that's why?!" He replied with unsteady eyes.<br><br>The lamia had an amusing smile, as she said to him with sharp eyes "Hee..are not you too gutsy to be able to flatter in this circumstance."<br><br>He immediately regretted what he said and tried to quickly clarify, "ahh..That was my habit kicking in, please let me go, I don't have any misgivings with you, I am just a simple mortal." He pleaded to her, trying to invoke any mercy. The lamia coiled around him tighter and moved her face closer to him.<br><br>"Don't worry, I will not harm you." She replied with a bright smile This didn't help him at all, the pouring of sweats rather increased in this cold night.<br><br>"What are you planning to do with me?" He doubtfully asked.<br><br>"I will show you later." She mysteriously replied and began to hasten her pace. It took only a few minutes before they were moving closer to a cave near a big clean pond where the sky was reflecting off. Being not able to contemplate anything to be out of this situation the man just went along with it. But in actuality, he was keeping a keen eye on everything.<br><br>'Haa..what have I landed myself into? I was just going to the village market before being hit by something.' He lamented with a droopy face.<br><br>Noticing the cave, he was surprised to see the inside having natural lights, which was coming from white gemstones, the lamia took him deeper and soon they reached a room that resembled a bedroom.<br><br>The man was strangely looking at her, trying to predict what was about to happen.<br><br>He asked her, "umm..what are we doing here?" The lamia turned around and stared at him in a peculiar gaze.<br><br>Before he was able to say anything, his lips were taken by her as she inserted her slithery long tongue in his, wrapping it in a whirly pattern and kissing him.<br><br>The young man was caught off guard, he tried to move away but she only coiled around him stronger, she was also rubbing her body with his figure, he could feel the perky meat buns and thought, maybe he was chosen as her mate.<br><br>Through a strong jolt, he freed his mouth from her and seriously gazed at her eyes.<br><br>"Are you sure, you want to do this? Innocentfairy." Her cheeks were crimson red, hearing him.<br><br>She shyly nodded at him, which intrigued him more.<br><br>"Why?" He calmly asked her. The young man was able to figure out much information just from the kiss alone, he could tell that she was immature and her features and act also exuded youthfulness. His shrewdness was hidden deep inside, acting to be what he actually was not always helped him in surviving. The cultivation was of a world where to survive you have to be resourceful and know your weakness. The young man began to contemplate how he could exploit her, but he first checked the water.<br><br>Noticing her not replying, he told her, "It's fine if you don't want to tell me. It's risky for a first-timer to take the initiative and do these types of things." He had the appearance of a teacher speaking to his student.<br><br>The lamia panicked, listening to him. She innocently responded with wide eyes, "Mom said to pick a man and mate, after you kiss."<br><br>"Do you know what to do after kissing." The young man inquired.<br><br>"You get naked and mate." The lamia ponderingly replied, loosening her coil around him a little. 'hehe..The plan is working out.' he evilly thought,<br><br>"Just do it!?." She thoughtlessly replied, gazing at the ceiling.<br><br>"Ah..lady, that won't do, you are going to harm yourself that way." He smilingly said, appearing to be harmless. But his thoughts were the opposite, 'ah..so dumb, monsters are really dumb, only having brute force, just wait, young lady' he lamented inwardly, planning on how to kill her.<br><br>"No..I don't want to get harmed.' The lamia told him, shaking him back and forth using her satin hands with blueish nails.<br><br>"Don't worry, I am here. I will help you." He responded in a friendly manner, trying to portray himself as weak as possible, giving her no clue about his deep intents. The lamia didn't hesitate at all before freeing him completely. After coming out of the coil, he stretched for a few seconds.<br><br>'Haa..so stupid, I better get done with her and leave quickly.' people would have some hesitations in their thoughts when encountering such an innocent girl but this man had no mercy, similarly, his heart had no warmth, it was a gloomy cold palace.<br><br>He approached the fidgeting lamia and took her to the bed.<br><br>"First, let's introduce ourselves. I am Leng, what is your name?" He asked she was sitting on his right thigh on the bed.<br><br>"LanBing.." She had flushed cheeks and her eyes were darting around somewhere else, trying to not meet with his.<br><br>'Hmm..why is this name so familiar.' He inwardly thought. Not pondering too much about it, he<br><br>initiated the kiss, her tongue had no chance as it was played around with by his tongue, dripping of saliva could be seen near the edges. The young man was also massaging her soft meat buns from under the inner garment. She also tried to reciprocate back equally, both hands were on his strong chest.<br><br>"Nnh" suppressed moans leaked whenever he was little rough with her twin peaks. As he swiftly took off the inner garments, the only thing left was the glistening meat buns with shiny red pearls. While hugging her he slowly laid her down on the bed and moved onto sucking her nipples and playing with the other peak using his right land, pinching it sometimes.<br><br>Only her moans and panting could be heard, she was gazing at him with misty eyes, squashing him with her dumplings. He made his way down while leaving kisses and saliva track, until her scales.<br><br>The young began to feel them, eliciting soft moans from her. After looking for a while, he found her pink ravine that was half exposed and half-covered under the scales, he proceeded to calm her down, massaging her sensitive regions gently. Just when he got the chance, he dived into savor it, his tongue slide through and tasted all the soft twitching muscles and a sourly-sweet flavor.<br><br>"Annhh..it feels weird..snh." She spoke in between her moans. 'Isn't this too small? Can my thing even fit inside' He thought.<br><br>Leng moved a little and removed all his clothes, exposing his raging rod. Seeing it, LanBing got all couped up and a little scared, hiding her pink ravine under the scales.<br><br>He sighed, seeing the situation and proceeded to comfort her.<br><br>"This is how mating works, don't fret." He spoke in a reassuring tone, petting her slim belly.<br><br>"Ok, wrap me." She listened to him and softly enveloped them both on the bed. Leng was fully enjoying the situation, being wrapped up by something this warm was a pleasurable experience that he had never experienced before.<br><br>He placed his rod on her entrance and embraced her with another hand which was going under her back toward soft scaly buttocks. Their bodies were inseparable in that position.<br><br>He initiated another kiss and she used her hand to go around his neck, wrapping him, caressing his polished back. He began to rub his rod's tip with her sacred ravine. For the last time, he ended the kiss and looked at her. Lanbing showed a mesmerizing and coiled a little stronger, making it slowly penetrate her.<br><br>"Uww.." She was making painful sounds, to mitigate it Leng would stop and then move, slowly going deeper, for the last part, he thrusted directly, as he deeply kissed her, eliciting a muffled shriek. Two tears were close to dropping near the ridges.<br><br>He halted there and began to caress her beautiful face with his right hand, removing the drops, also calming her down. The spot where they were joined had blood scattered about, which would only happen whenever it was the first time for a lamia.<br><br>After some time, he kissed her and started thrusting at a slow pace, feeling all the rigid surface that was trying to suck him inside and milk him. It was his first time doing it with a lamia and it was honestly too blissful, if not for his high endurance, he would have came already.<br><br>He increased his pace as time went by, soon only the sound of two bodies slapping could be heard in the cave. The lamia would often gaze at him deep affection and love, puzzling him.<br><br>He guessed they were just like this with their partners.<br><br>It was deep lovemaking that lasted for a while before Langbin felt the build up of something she never felt before.<br><br>"Annh..something is coming!!"<br><br>"Let it come." Leng replied, he was leaving hickeys near her neck region as he sucked on the tender flesh.<br><br>When the moment came, she firmly enveloped him and moaned aloud<br><br>"annhHH.." releasing tons of love juices. Leng didn't hold back and with a hard thrust, he poured out his seed inside her womb, spurting lot. Enough to make her pregnant.<br><br>Lanbing was huffing alot, she hid her face in his chest, entangled her long fingers with him and spoke, "So that's how mating is done..mmh"<br><br>"We can do it lots from now on." He mischievously replied.<br><br>She fully hid her blushed cheeks.<br><br>"Yes..h-husband." Leng gave her a soft kiss on her hair, hearing it.<br><br>Both then dozed off. Well, only Lanbin, Leng woke up when she fell asleep.<br><br>He was gazing at her face from up with sharp emotionless yes.<br><br>'Haa...so unfortunate' Lamented with a cruel smile. He got off the bed and searched his clothes where he got a knife from. The blade was shining under the white light. He moved it near her neck, ready to slice it apart.<br>`,

Usually, he would have gone back to sleep, convincing himself there was still time. Not this time.<br><br>That didn't happen often. It should have made him think.<br><br>This morning, the young man untangled himself surprisingly well from his blankets. Rising shirtless, six feet tall, and over twenty years old, the first thought you'd have when you saw him would have been that he was... average looking.<br><br>Despite being slightly overweight, he looked good with his clothes on. Someone observant enough might perceive the outline of a few muscles, remnants of an ancient past where he was willing to work out and moderate his junk food intake. But today, his motivation was running out.<br><br>His skin was pale and he had dark circles under his eyes. He played too many video games and worked daily on the computer. A little acne, not a lot, but enough to show that he was going off the rails.<br><br>A brown mane, never touched by scissors, and a two-week-old thick beard decorated all these flattering features. Fortunately, his face still had some potential.<br><br>Fine, sharp traits and smoldering eyes contrasted with his lack of delicacy. From time to time, a sad melancholic glint would replace it, quickly stifled by a frown.<br><br>This young man's name was Jake Wilderth. Orphaned since the age of three, his parents had died in the fake Third World War in 2084 like many others. He was 25 years old today. Raised since then by his uncle Kalen with his cousin Anya - his uncle's daughter - his childhood had been a quiet river. Well, almost.<br><br>The Wilderths were an old family, not aristocratic or bourgeois, but arrogant and demanding enough to give a hard life to their descendants. Why would you ask? No family heirloom, no historical secrets, no great cause to defend. Then what was it? Pure pride.<br><br>The Wilderths all had one thing in common. They were smart. Not miraculously smart or geniuses of the century. It was actually a standard IQ of 130 or higher.<br><br>Some might say that genetic didn't matter so much or that IQ was not a good measure of intelligence. Emotional intelligence was, after all, much more useful when it came to being successful in life.<br><br>Yet, when it became a generality in a large family, it changed everything. When a child was limited or mentally retarded, the parents would be much more tolerant, letting them do what they wanted. There would be no requirements.<br><br>When the child was exceptional, in contrast to the previous example, parents would become strict. On the one hand, they would not want their child to waste his or her talent. On the other hand, they would often unconsciously transfer their own failed dreams to them.<br><br>With the Wilderths, there was a third consideration. Not to embarrass themselves. If you were more successful than your cousins, aunts or uncles, that was fine, but you couldn't be less successful. The mockery born of comparisons would nip any form of happiness in the bud.<br><br>That's what happened to Jake. His uncle was benevolent and his cousin Anya protective. He grew up peacefully. Yet, whether it was because he was introverted or because the death of his first parents affected him, he had few friends. The excellent facilities at school made it easy for him to go to university, but never taught him to cram and work hard.<br><br>The sheltered life created an indecisive and procrastinating mindset. He had no idea what he wanted to do with his life, as increasing pressure from other family members made him increasingly uncomfortable. Like many lonely and asocial nerds before him, he found a way out of reality by reading, binge-watching and playing video games.<br><br>It wasn't so bad. As an intelligent and logical man, he chose to link his future career to his current pleasures. He then enrolled in a university specializing in programming and informatics.<br><br>Unfortunately, he soon got bored. The volume of learning was incomparable with the amount of work in high school. Even for him, it required some effort. The pleasure of playing video games and the pleasure of making them were as far apart as possible. The consequence of this was that he dropped out.<br><br>He tried a few curricula such as management or cybernetics, but the boredom was still strong. He came out with a degree in cybernetics and programming, with his uncle discreetly using his circle of acquaintances to<br><br>save this sinking ship of a nephew.<br><br>This academic path might have seemed strange at the beginning of the 21st century, but not in the 22nd.<br><br>The technology of quantum computing was mature. The limit predicted for the miniaturization of transistors by Moore's Law had been solved. The performance of computers had again improved rapidly.<br><br>Artificial intelligence and bioengineering had made huge advances. Nano-cybernetics was also on the right track. Earth had managed to create its first colony on Mars more than 40 years ago. 3D printing was perfected, even allowing organs to be duplicated or recreated using donor cells as ink. And yes, medicine had also developed a lot.<br><br>Fortunately for the people of Earth... We could still feel the ravages of the fake Third World War everywhere. Even 25 years later. <br><br>After 2070, geopolitical tensions escalated. The Earth had more than 10 billion inhabitants and access to drinking water was no longer guaranteed. Global warming accelerated the melting of sea ice, leading to the disappearance under water of many well-known coastal cities and a group of oceanic islands.<br><br>Rich countries such as the United States or China adapted easily, making the necessary investments to protect key coastal cities such as New York or Shanghai. Poorer states have had to relocate part of their population inland, suffering a net loss of territory.<br><br>Oil, water, precious metals or gemstones: as the world continued to drain fossil energies, their market value continued to skyrocket. Naturally, conflicts became more and more frequent.<br><br>In 2084, the Third World War was about to break out.<br><br>On May 14 of that same year, a terrible war did indeed break out, but it was far from what it should have been. Even today, the mystery had not yet been completely solved.<br><br>To sum it up in one sentence: Every major city was annihilated in a single day. Moscow, Tokyo, Paris, Washington, London; the names of every capital city one could think of had been erased from the face of the Earth. No explanation was given. No adventurous war reporter crossed the military cordon that cut off civilian access to these areas.<br><br>Indeed, many people had testified to seeing dazzling nuclear mushrooms blooming in most of these cities.However, many incongruities had quickly manifested themselves through millions of strange testimonies.<br><br>No government could completely silence the voice of its people.<br><br>The first anomaly was that all contact - whether by telephone or the Internet - had been cut off a few days before the nuclear missiles were fired. Some family members, friends and lovers who made a phone call to people living or working in these big cities had simply heard a loud static noise before hanging up without being able to intervene.<br><br>After communications were lost, no one came back. Even these days, the governments had not yet given a satisfying justification to the victims' relatives. Add to this the weird evidences via photos or phone videos of psychedelic rainbow light coming from these places, or the few pictures of uncanny airships.<br><br>People didn't need more to speculate and go with a theory of their own.<br><br>The terrorist or Third World War theories were, in fact, the less popular. The dominant one was the alien invasion. Not on account of the rare peculiar ship pictures or government silence, but because an Earth Government saw the light of day soon after.<br><br>If you once had in your life any interest in history or politic, you then probably know that even if there was a clear loser from either side, negotiations should have taken a long time. Months if not years before agreeing for a consensus. Especially in the theoretical case of a Third World War in which many countries would be involved.<br><br>However, it happened. The Earth Government or United Earth Government. Created in barely four days, every religion and power speaking out from the same voice.<br><br>Understandably, this new Earth Government couldn't give no response at all either. They chose a rarely seen solution in politic: temporize. Two years after the 'False Third World War', as it was called now, the stabilized government made an announcement to pacify the mobs. It was rebroadcasted so many times that Jake could recite it by heart, in spite of his young age back then.<br><br>"What happened on the 14th of May is so unprecedented that it is impossible to be summed in a few words. Regrettably, we are unable to reveal the whole of what transpired at this time. As, we are still investigating to this day. What we have uncovered so far is likely the only news worthy of the term "earth-shattering" to the point that most people, including us, are woefully unprepared to even hear it. However, in spite of that fact, in the years to come, the way we live will change. We will adapt and prepare for what is to come."<br><br>"A day will come, in approximately two decades from now, where our changes must be solidified. It will be a point of no return, so our wills must be as iron. As, even we do not know the exact day of our reckoning.<br><br>"But, whether it is one year earlier or two months after our projection, that day will come. From then on our lives will be forever changed.<br><br>"It is our hope that we will all be ready."<br><br>It was twenty-two years ago. They were two years off.<br><br>Jake, that was now brushing his teeth, didn't know that this morning when he woke up, his life would take a turn he could never have imagined. The day everything changed.<br>`,

		name: `The Monk That Wanted To Renounce Asceticism`,
		originalDesc: `In the rural northeastern mountainous regions stands a tiny Buddhist temple, named One Finger Temple. It isn't a large one but it is extremely miraculous.<br><br>The temple has rice that emanates an aromatic fragrance.<br><br>The temple has sweet and refreshing water that rivals ambrosia.<br><br>The temple has Buddhas that grant wishes to the sincere.<br><br>The temple isn't large but it has everything. The temple isn't large but it has flourishing incense offerings that far exceed all temples. The temple isn't large but it attracts both citizens and foreigners that line up overnight…<br><br>The temple has a bald but handsome monk. Every day, he would bawl, "I want to renounce asceticism! I want to marry a chick that's not too pretty, have a cute baby, and lead a stable life!"<br><br>This book is a casual novel that introduces various Chinese traditional customs, as well as Buddhist ones. It strives to be a positive book, allowing people to reflect on how they should live their lives and treat others.`,
		chapter: `<br><br>This story begins in a parallel world.<br><br>With the fair refreshing weather of autumn in the far north. White clouds floating gently in the sky and birds taking their migratory flight flowing with the wind. The gentle breeze stirred through the fallen leaves creating a soft, gentle rustle. What a beautiful autumn day!<br><br>A common thought for most common men, one such man being the solitary exception.<br><br>In the southwestern corner of Gulin City was a mountain named Mt. Tongtian. It was one of the outcrops of the Changbai mountain range. On one corner of said mountain range stood a single peak named Mt. One Finger. The mountain wasn't extremely tall, with its peak clawing towards the sky, but the breathtaking view of the periphery of the Heavenly Lake of Tianshan was blocked. At the top of this mountain stood a Buddhist temple called the One Finger Temple! One Finger Temple had two sanctums. The front-facing sanctum was the shrine, while the one in the back was the meditation monastery. This was also the communal living space of the monks, to be precise it was where the acolyte monk, Fangzheng, lived. This solitary monk was the sole inhabitant of One Finger Temple.<br><br>Just days ago, the One Finger Temple's abbot One Finger, had passed away. The desolate temple, which now lacked any and all alms, was slowly but surely wasting away to the passage of time.<br><br>There was a single bodhi tree in the courtyard that was brought from the far south by an aspiring rich man. This man had tragically died once the bodhi tree had been planted. The result? What was meant to be a complete renovation of the temple ended in crumbles, the plans to restore the temple to the magnificence it once had… were lost.<br><br>Furthermore, the bodhi tree had frozen and perished not even a year since it had been planted because of the frigid northern weather. Now only the withered remnants of the once beautiful tree remained. More than once Fangzheng had entertained the thought of one day chopping it down for firewood. Yet in the end, he could not bring himself to do so.<br><br>At this particular moment in time, Fangzheng stood under the bodhi tree with an official document in his hand. His eyes filled with misery as he looked up to the sky, he voiced his dissatisfaction, "Amitabha, what the f*ck!? All I wanted was to renounce my asceticism! Why would you give me this bloody document!? I have to be the abbot of this bloody temple just because of this f*cking document!? First of all, this darn temple doesn't have any money and secondly, it has no other inhabitants! We don't receive alms from incense donations, other than the winds and storms that provide for this place, it has nothing worthwhile!"<br><br>He sighed, eyes downcast. "… All I wanted was to be an ordinary person. To marry someone, have a kid before I embrace the gentle caress of death. Was that too much to ask? It was not easy for the old monk to raise me, he was an admirable man, so I endured it. But now that the old monk has passed away, I am asked to spend the rest of my days in this broken down old temple? No! Absolutely not!"<br><br>With that said Fangzheng crumpled the document and threw it into a gap of the withered bodhi tree.<br><br>He returned to his room and grabbed his luggage, preparing to leave!<br><br>Once he reached the One Finger Temple's entrance, he came to a halt. He turned back and stared at the worn down plaque of One Finger Temple and could not help but reminisce about the old monk, Zen Master One Finger, who had raised him ever since he was young. The reason for the old monk's name was because he truly only had one finger. What could he do with one finger? Most people would probably be rendered useless, incapable of keeping up with the daily order of business. Zen Master One Finger, contrary to all expectation, had managed to cultivate a plot of land and through alms and selling his produce had worked to afford Fangzheng's education throughout high school.<br><br>It was at this very entrance that Zen Master One Finger had walked with him down the mountain every single day to send him off on his way to school.<br><br>It was also this entrance where Fangzheng would find Zen Master One Finger waiting by the door with a gentle smile whenever he returned.<br><br>As days turned to years, Fangzheng grew taller and Zen Master One Finger bent under his arduous life. His hunching back worsened and arthritis plagued the elderly monk. Not once had he seen that Zen Master One Finger was suffering from excruciating pain. A permanent and gentle smile always found its place on the old monk's face. He would tap his back and smile at the young Fangzheng, "I've been watching you grow up and become a strong healthy young man. It's a true relief to have such a reliable heir to my old temple."<br><br>Every time Fangzheng heard that sentence he would choke up and bite back tears. He would think to himself, "The old man acts nothing like an esteemed monk! Shouldn't an esteemed monk like him speak in thought-provoking gathas?" Instead of the gathas one expected to hear it was the gentle slap of reality.<br><br>Unfortunately, high school had proven to be too expensive. Zen Master One Finger could no longer provide for Fangzheng's continued education due to his failing health. Fangzheng, bound both by duty and emotion, returned to the mountain to attend to the man that raised him. Zen Master One Finger, despite his advancing years sternly forbade him from working the farm and harvesting produce. Instead, he was asked to study the Buddhist scriptures and teachings. As for chores like cooking and fetching water from the well, Zen Master One finger took them all on himself.<br><br>Three years passed before the old monk could hold on no longer and passed away.<br><br>It had been three years since Fangzheng stopped attending high school. Other people his age were probably seniors in university yet here he was, stuck, bound by duty to the mountain that held the decaying temple. It was a matter that filled Fangzheng with some resentment. He had tried to tell Zen Master One Finger more than once that he wanted to seek employment in the outside world and lead a normal life. He did not wish to sever his bonds to worldly pleasure and live the life of an ascetic.<br><br>Yet whenever Fangzheng saw the old monk's pained expression whenever he mentioned "seek employment and lead a normal life," his words ground to a halt, and he kept his tongue.<br><br>Fangzheng always felt like the Monkey King, Sun Wukong, while Zen Master One Finger was the Golden Hoop. Just as the magical headband in the legend would tighten and cause an unbearable headache, the old man tightened his hold on him in a similar manner to the headband, granting him little freedom. Now that the old monk had passed away, he realized how wrong he had been! Zen Master One Finger was not the Golden Hoop, but the only person who meant anything to him, that very worldly connection that he claimed to be searching for.<br><br>He was like a father, a mother, everything!<br><br>The realization crushed Fangzheng, and emotions welled up behind his eyes until he could no longer hold back the tide. He knelt in front of Zen Master One Finger's grave and wept. Once he finally returned to the mountain and the memories of old crashed into his soul, he felt the same dam break once more, the tears welled up. He found a corner and stayed there, one day turned to two, two turned to four and eventually, he remained in the corner for an entire week.<br><br>The first six days had been because of the raw emotions connected to the loss of his only relative, the small fact that they had not been related by blood was irrelevant. The final day was mostly because of the growing hunger.<br><br>Thankfully, civil servants arrived on the seventh day. They had brought him rice and left behind a document. It promoted Fangzheng from acolyte to abbot! Although the temple wasn't ruled by the government nor were any promotions dictated by them, the document still had worth. At the very least, Fangzheng was now the official owner of the temple.<br><br>Fangzheng did not plan on continuing as a monk. He wanted to renounce his asceticism and return to the secular world. He wanted to marry and have children. He wanted to live a peaceful life! He did not want to continue struggling against poverty!<br><br>When he thought of that, Fangzheng turned his head and looked at the patroness of female fertility, Guan Yin Bodhisattva. He bellowed furiously, "Why? Why do we worship you only to be poor? I'm not worshiping you anymore! I'm done! I'm leaving!"<br><br>"Ding!" A crisp sound echoed in Fangzheng's head. He jumped and twisted around surveying the area. "Who is it?"<br><br>"Congratulations Host. You have satisfied the requirements of activating the Buddha System by successfully owning a temple. From this moment on, you will enjoy the protection of the heavens and be augmented by the myriad worlds."<br><br>"What the heck?" Fangzheng's first thought was that it was a practical joke, but after checking his surroundings he found them empty.<br><br>He searched his body and found only his cellphone. It was an older Nokia model. It could handle calls and be used to crush walnuts! It had two melodic tunes and if it did have internet access, it was barely usable. It was truly the most sluggish of phones… The government had once installed an internet line to the mountain, but it had been damaged years ago. Without the Internet, it was impossible for such a gizmo to show its meager use.<br><br>As for everything else, it had nothing to do with the modern world, much less anything able to make such a sound.<br><br>"Ding! Host, I am the Buddhist System. You are the chosen one of Buddha."<br><br>"System? Buddha System?" Fangzheng suddenly realized something as he exclaimed, "A cheat!?"<br><br>"You can interpret it in that manner."<br><br>"Then, what can you bring me?" Fangzheng asked before he said with a wry smile, "Actually, don't worry about it. I'm a person who is about to return to the secular world. I'm not going to be some Buddha…"<br><br>"I think I'll to give it some consideration! After all, I'm an intelligent individual! Old Dad One Finger said so before." Fangzheng hurriedly changed his statement.<br><br>"Will not be provided!" the system added with a happy tone.<br><br>"Son of a! Are you kidding me? That's it, I'm out!" Fangzheng grabbed his luggage and made for the entrance.<br><br>The System's voice sounded once again. "However, I can help you become an abbot, a master that will be respected by thousands of people. You will be able to make One Finger Temple the biggest in this world!"<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>I dreamt of a world where I was a normal boy. Born in a normal family. Studied in a normal school. And had normal friends.<br><br>In that world, I was happy, but there was a sort of dissatisfaction and the need for excitement. I wanted to be rid of my normal life and the normal cycle of life.<br><br>So when I saw a girl about to be mugged and killed, I moved...and I died because of it. I have no idea if the girl made it out safely or not since that was the end of my dream.<br><br>It's certainly a tragic ending, I thought. Then I also thought, was this just a dream?<br><br>Why so? Because as I look at my body, I only see my little hands and feet...I had become a baby!<br><br>This must be the so-called reincarnation or transmigration. Honestly, I am sometimes confused regarding the two.<br><br>Whatever it is, I am now in the body of a baby. And it's impossible for a baby to be able to think as I do.<br><br>How did this happen? I have no idea. There's no one I can ask as well.<br><br>Looking around, I found myself in a crib inside a dark room.<br><br>From the windows, I can see it was a dark night outside and it was also raining. Occasionally, the sound of thunder could be heard and flashes of lightning could be seen.<br><br>Suddenly, I heard noises from behind the door.<br><br>It sounded like an old man and a boy were talking. After a while, they opened the door and walked over to me.<br><br>The old man had a balding head with only a bit of white hair left but it was still neatly combed. He stood straight despite being old and wore butler-ish clothes. Hold on, I guess he is indeed a butler?<br><br>Is my new family so rich to actually have butlers?<br><br>As for the boy, he looked to be about 8 years old. He had a somewhat handsome and childish face. His hair was as black as the night and his eyes were red as if he had just spent the whole day crying.<br><br>Is this my brother? I mean, he can't be my father, right? Or maybe a cousin? The butler's son?<br><br>"Master Bruce, you still have young master Lucas. You have to be strong."<br><br>"...I know Alfred...I know…"<br><br>...Hold up, his name is Bruce and the old butler is Alfred!? Is he Batman or what!?<br><br>"With both of your parents...gone. I'm afraid the Wayne family now only has you two."<br><br>"...I know...little brother, I know you can't understand me yet...but everything's going to be alright. I promise."<br><br>...Wayne!? Little brother!?<br><br>This...this...is this some sort of prank or...am I really Batman's little brother!?<br><br>Heck, I didn't know Batman even HAD a little brother!...Or no, I think there was a multiverse where he had a brother but I wasn't familiar with it...<br><br>Inwardly shaking away these thoughts, I remembered what they just said.<br><br>That their parents are now gone...meaning, dead. This must be the night they were murdered...what a strange coincidence.<br><br>I was brought into this world the day Batman's parents died…<br><br>Looking at the red eyes of my...brother, Bruce, I knew how devastated he felt right now. In the original Batman story, Bruce was alone after his parents were killed and he didn't have much support at the start other than Alfred.<br><br>This caused him to become Batman in the end. But now, it's different. Bruce has a real blood-related family close to him that is still alive. My existence can actually cause Bruce to...not become Batman.<br><br>But...is that a good thing? I wasn't sure. My actions may lead to the world having no Batman but...seeing this big brother of mine who's trying hard not to cry in front of his little brother has moved my feelings.<br><br>I gave him a smile. Bruce was surprised but smiled back.<br><br>When I saw him smile, I felt it...I felt that the Batman I knew had changed...<br><br>Time flew, I was now 10 years old. Bruce is also around 18 years old now. Neither of us attended school but was home tutored by Alfred instead.<br><br>At first, Alfred insisted we go to school but Bruce refused so I also refused, saying that I would accompany my brother instead.<br><br>As such, us 2 brothers got closer to each other as time passed. Still, I can tell that when I'm not around, Bruce would have a solemn and lonely look in his eyes. He still can't forget that night our parents died.<br><br>There was nothing I could do about it except try to fill in the gap our parents left behind in him. In about 2 years, Bruce will meet a man named Henri Duncan who would train him on how to fight. However, he is actually Ras Al Ghul, the Demon's Head of the League of Assassins…<br><br>I have no idea if I can stop this...or if I should...After all, I knew that this world needs a Batman. Even Superman needs Batman...without Batman, the Justice League will not exist.<br><br>Replace Bruce as Batman? No, I can't do that. If I did replace him as Batman, then what would Bruce do? How will he cope with the trauma of our parents' death?<br><br>There's even a high chance that he will...accept Ras offer and become the new Demon's Head!<br><br>I can only sigh as I thought of this.<br><br>Now that I was 10 years old, Bruce and Alfred finally agreed about letting me out of the manor and explore Gotham city.<br><br>Still, Alfred insisted on coming along to be safe and I couldn't refuse him so I can only nod and let him follow.<br><br>The Wayne manor was located a bit away from the city itself so Alfred had to drive us over there. I asked him to park the car somewhere so we can just walk and explore Gotham on foot.<br><br>After getting out of the car and looked around the city, I grinned in my mind.<br><br>Ah! This is Gotham City! Home to Batman, Joker, Penguin, Riddler, and all those crazy villains! Oh, and Jim Gordon too!<br><br>I have to say, reading the comics, watching the series, movies, or animes is completely different from walking here for real!<br><br>The scenery is making me grin non stop in my head as I try not to show too much excitement in my face since Alfred might think it's weird.<br><br>Of course, since this is Gotham, then there would definitely be thugs and bullies.<br><br>An example is the one we are seeing now.<br><br>In the alleyway of two buildings, there was a guy mugging another guy. And in broad daylight too!<br><br>I frowned as I saw this and was about to speak up when someone beat me to it.<br><br>The mugger looked annoyed as he turned his head and saw a red-haired young girl with freckles who looked about 12 years old.<br><br>���Beat it brat! This is none of your business!"<br><br>"You should stop right now! My dad's a cop and he's already coming over!"<br><br>This time, the mugger was pissed. He charged at the girl, intending to harm her or maybe use her as a hostage in case what she said was the truth.<br><br>However, it was time I stepped in.<br><br>"Alfred! I choose you! Use tackle!"<br><br>"...As you wish young master."<br><br>Alfred was a bit speechless but still tackled the mugger.<br><br>I knew he was an ex-soldier and despite being old, fighting some roadside muggers is something he can easily do.<br><br>In an instant, the mugger was incapacitated.<br><br>The victim earlier had already run off without thanking his rescuers as there was nothing taken from him in the end.<br><br>I scratched my head and thought about how different the people of Gotham is from my previous world.<br><br>Helplessly, I could only look at the redhead girl and greeted her.<br><br>"Well, being a hero is good and all but without skills, you shouldn't be so reckless."<br><br>���Uuu...I have skills! My dad taught me self-defense!"<br><br>"Which is meant to protect you in case you are attacked. I'm sure he didn't teach that to you so you can find trouble yourself."<br><br>I shook my head and sighed.<br><br>The girl seemed to have been infuriated with this and angrily stomped her feet.<br><br>"You...why are you even scolding me!? I didn't do anything bad! Also, you're younger than me!"<br><br>"Don't get me wrong. I'm not scolding you. In fact, I respect that you stood up despite your age. I just didn't want you to be so reckless next time. My parents died because of a mugger. And that could happen to you if we aren't here just now."<br><br>Hearing what I said made the girl pause and even Alfred looked at me in surprise.<br><br>"Young master...you...you knew?"<br><br>"Of course I knew. Despite you and big brother keeping it a secret, there's this thing called the internet now you know? The Waynes being killed is kind of a big deal and as long as I search Wayne in Google, that news would always pop up."<br><br>"...We only wanted you to live happily without any worries."<br><br>"I'm not worried about my parents. I barely knew and remember them. What I'm more worried about is big brother. He saw what happened with his own eyes...even a child can tell how sad and broken he must feel like."<br><br>I shook my head and turned back to the girl who now had an awkward expression.<br><br>"U-umm...that...I'm sorry, I didn't know…"<br><br>"It's fine. Right, I'm Lucas by the way. Lucas Wayne."<br><br>"Uh, my name's Barbara. Barbara Gordon."<br><br>...Well damn. Turns out, this chick is the future Batgirl and Oracle! Jim Gordon's daughter!<br><br>I cleared my throat in an attempt to calm myself down.<br><br>"Hmm, that uniform...are you supposed to go to school or something?"<br><br>"Ah! Shoot! I totally forgot! I'm so going to be late!"<br><br>Barbara quickly looked at her watch and panicked.<br><br>"I gotta go! Ah, right, do you have a Facebook account?" (AN: lol, idk, too lazy to make stuff up XD)<br><br>"Good! I'll add you later so you better accept it! Talk to you later!"<br><br>I stood there as I watched her disappear from my vision.<br><br>I must admit, it's making me a bit nostalgic from my previous life when I still went to school like normal.<br><br>I sighed again and continued to roam Gotham with Alfred.<br><br>The day passed as Alfred and Lucas finished looking around Gotham.<br><br>When Alfred saw that Lucas had gotten back to his room, he sighed and went to find Bruce in the study room.<br><br>"Master Bruce, we have returned."<br><br>"Alfred, you're here. How was it? Did Lucas enjoy the walk?"<br><br>"Yes. In the beginning, though he tried to hide it, I could tell he was very much excited to walk around the city."<br><br>Hearing that, Bruce smiled and nodded.<br><br>"Good, that's good. As long as he's happy."<br><br>"However, while we were walking around the city, we came across a mugger…"<br><br>"What!? What happened!? Is he hurt!?"<br><br>"Please calm down sir. Young master Lucas is fine and unhurt. In fact, he handled the situation perfectly."<br><br>Alfred proceeded to explain the events that happened earlier.<br><br>In the end, Bruce calmed down and sighed.<br><br>"Yes...and it's not only him who is worried about you sir. I am also worried."<br><br>Bruce fell silent, not sure what to say.<br><br>Eventually, he changed the topic instead.<br><br>"So this Barbara girl...Lucas seemed interested in her?"<br><br>"...It seems so. He tried to act calm when they met but I can see he is indeed interested."<br><br>"Heh, this brat is really growing up. Actually already interested in girls!"<br><br>"I think he got that from you, sir."<br><br>Bruce was speechless again!<br><br>Actually, Lucas did try to hide his expressions earlier but he didn't know that Alfred is just too good at reading expressions! It was unknown what Lucas would do if he knew that Alfred noticed those expressions he tried to hide.<br><br>It was a good thing that Lucas is not present at the moment.<br><br>"Still, school huh? We should really get Lucas to go to school."<br><br>"But he won't if you don't. He is worried about you, sir."<br><br>"...Then I'll also attend school."<br><br>Alfred smiled and nodded excitedly.<br><br>"Then I will make the arrangements sir."<br><br>Towards Alfred's excitement, Bruce can only smile wryly and shook his head.<br><br>When Alfred left, Bruce's smile disappeared and he went back to his solemn look, seemingly considering a few things.<br><br>At this moment, I was staring at the ceiling while considering the future.<br><br>In truth, Batman should be the least of my worries. I knew that there are other beings in this universe that can cause a lot of havoc and deaths.<br><br>For example, Darkseid, or even Anti-Monitor.<br><br>Can I even fight against beings like those?<br><br>I know that Batman has no powers and he can still fight alongside Superman but...it's not something just anyone can do.<br><br>Just then, something weird appeared in front of my vision.<br><br>[DC System installation complete.]<br><br>[Welcome host, to the DC System.]<br><br>[The System is capable of allowing the host to fully copy DC characters' powers and skills depending on your synchronization rate with them.]<br><br>[You can increase synchronization rate by getting to know the character, fighting them, beating them, killing them, and such.]<br><br>[Host's current level is 1. You are only allowed to register 1 character to be synchronized.]<br><br>[You can gain experience points by completing the System's missions.]<br><br>Seeing all these windows popping up blew my mind away.<br><br>I simply can't believe it! A freaking system! And it allows me to copy the powers and skills of DC characters!<br><br>Haha, with this, does Darkseid even matter!?<br><br>If I can get to know Superman...hehe, wouldn't I get Superman's powers then?<br><br>I was excited and had to spend about an hour just to calm myself down. Once I did, I asked the System in my head.<br><br>'System, where did you come from? Why appear now?'<br><br>[Answering host, you do not have the required level to know where I came from. As for my sudden appearance, the DC System is a large file that needed 10 years to download completely.]<br><br>Well, that's certainly a lot. Actually, how can it even download in my brain? I'm no cyborg...whatever, let's just throw it in the magic trash can.<br><br>'This level thing...can I see how many experience I need to get?'<br><br>[Host can open up his status window by simply thinking of it.]<br><br>BlankHuh, well, it seems to be pretty straight forward…<br><br>'Then what about this mission thing?'<br><br>[Currently, there are no missions available. I suggest the host to get out of the house more.]<br><br>Dammit, what kind of system is this!<br><br>Sigh, anyway, I should think of who to get for that 1 character slot…<br><br>Bruce? But he's still not Batman, would that even do anything?<br><br>'System, can I remove a character once slotted?'<br><br>I guess I can only wait for him to be Batman before I slot his character.<br><br>Then...who should I choose which I can easily gain sync rate?<br><br>...There are not really many supervillains at this point in time huh?<br><br>Without much of a choice, I can only leave this character slot blank.<br><br>...Or maybe I can take a trip to Smallville and meet Clark Kent? I think he should still be in high school at this point…<br><br>The problem is how to convince Bruce and Alfred…<br><br>No good, I can't think of anything...am I really supposed to wait until I grow up?<br><br>Just as I was getting depressed, someone knocked on my door.<br><br>Alfred opened the door and handed me a letter and a uniform.<br><br>"Master Bruce has decided to go to Gotham Academy and wanted you to join him at school tomorrow."<br><br>Eh? Isn't this too fast? When did they decide this? I even have a uniform already?<br><br>"Master Bruce will be a 3rd-year student while you will be in Grade 3."<br><br>Grade 3? I'm just 10 years old, isn't it supposed to be Grade 1? Well, not like it matters to me since I'm a reincarnated person but...<br><br>Alfred doesn't seem to care about my opinion and tossed the uniform and papers to me.<br><br>"You should sleep. Don't be late for your first day of school."<br><br>Just like that, he left the room.<br><br>And to finish, a pop up appeared in front of me.<br><br>[Mission: Attend Gotham Academy.]<br><br>[Failure: DC System is deleted.]<br>`,

According to my memory, I felt under the weather and decided to skip my work. Then, I had gone to sleep. The next moment, I woke up here. Just what is going on?)<br><br>I was confused. I need answers!<br><br>Then, someone spoke up to me.<br><br>"Sanada, can you lend me a bit of pencil lead?"<br><br>I turned my head to this mysterious guy. When I saw his face, I felt nostalgic.<br><br>His surname was Fujimoto. According to my memory as Sanada Seiji, he was my only friend in senior high school.<br><br>Even though we were friends, we were not close enough to call each other with our given name.<br><br>Fujimoto was someone whom I had not met even once after graduating from senior high school.<br><br>As I felt nostalgic when seeing Fujimoto, I finally noticed that I did not only replace the real owner of my current body. I fully absorbed him.<br><br>Or was it the other way around? Anyway, I realized that I became Sanada Seiji, and Sanada Seiji was me.<br><br>I did not feel an existential crisis. I still felt like myself, albeit with the twenty-seven-years-old Sanada Seiji's memory, experience, and feelings.<br><br>"Oy! Stop looking at me like that! You give me creep!"<br><br>Fujimoto hissed at me, making me feel annoyed.<br><br>However, I ignored my annoyance because I realized that Fujimoto was speaking Japanese.<br><br>Japanese was a language that I was not proficient in my previous life.<br><br>I was not sure if my new proficiency in Japanese was due to my life as Sanada Seiji, or because of my 'Language Compression' trait/ability.<br><br>If it was the former, then…<br><br>(Feels like I wasted my five CPs for it…)<br><br>'Language Comprehension' was the second trait/ability that I had picked up.<br><br>With that trait/ability, I had an intuitive understanding and proficiency in all languages. Spoken and written.<br><br>Admittedly, 'Language Comprehension' was limited to a manner of communication that could be considered as an actual language.<br><br>Due to that limitation, I could not understand animal voices and unintelligible gibberish.<br><br>Anyway, I had picked 'Language Comprehension' due to my concern about getting transported in an unknown world without understanding the spoken and written language.<br><br>The language barrier could be a hassle, and I did not want to experience such a bothersome matter.<br><br>There was also the fact that miscommunication could lead to something fatal.<br><br>All that aside, I am now apparently in Japan in the 21st century.<br><br>(This is good. Just like what I wanted!)<br><br>And yet, I was still unsure because of the discrepancies in my memories as Sanada Seiji.<br><br>I disregarded Fujimoto and pulled out my cell phone from my pockets. When I checked the date, I found that today was April 24th.<br><br>10 years ago, according to my memory as Sanada Seiji.<br><br>(Huh? I was not only transmigrated but also traveled back in time?! What the hell?!)<br><br>"Hey, Sanada! Why are you taking out your cellphone?! Hiragi-chan is looking this way! Don't bring out your cell phone right now!" Fujimoto warned me.<br><br>I turned my head to the front of the class after hearing the name that was spoken by Fujimoto.<br><br>(Hiragi-chan? Was it the same Hiragi Haruka-chan who taught World History?)<br><br>I thought, supplied by my memory as Sanada Seiji.<br><br>In front of the blackboard, there stood a young female teacher. She had stopped writing on the board with her chalk and was looking at me over her shoulder.<br><br>—Hiragi Haruka. 24 years old. One of World History teachers. Popular because of her young age and attractive appearance. Marital status, still single.<br><br>Haruka wore a white blouse, tight jeans, and pink high-heeled shoes.<br><br>She had pink hair tied into a ponytail behind her head and a pair of soulful blue eyes.<br><br>Her height was average, around the high-end of 160s, in centimeters. She had an outrageously curvaceous figure, though.<br><br>There were these strange feelings when I examined Hiragi Haruka-sensei.<br><br>I noticed the bittersweet feeling of unrequited love when I saw her. Furthermore, Hiragi Haruka looked somewhat familiar.<br><br>Or at least, the original me from my previous life felt a sense of familiarity when I saw her.<br><br>Actually, the combination of my new name, the strange time-traveling ability, and the female teacher's name, as well as her look, was quite familiar.<br><br>Why did it feel so familiar? Had I read a work of fiction with elements matching what I discovered at this moment?<br><br>I focused inward and searched for the answer in the memory of my old life.<br><br>Soon, I found the reason for familiarity.<br><br>(Huh? I woke up as the male lead in 'The Results From When I Time Leaped and Confessed to the Teacher I Liked at the Time' right at his first Time-Leap!)<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>When I came to, I was on a bed, looking up at wooden panels above me.<br><br>My mattress was lumpy and uncomfortable. My slight movements caused creaks and squeaks to sound out.<br><br>Lying down with my hand reaching up, I, "Huang Yu", was hit with a sudden throbbing in the head.<br><br>My body was wet with sweat, though it wasn't because of the heat. Rather, it was a cold sweat that sent shivers down my spine.<br><br>Twisting and turning in the bed, the throbbing in my head was like an unbearable torture.<br><br>I could feel bile coming up my throat, but I forcefully swallowed it all down.<br><br>As the throbbing in my head slowly faded, a sense of relief filled me. Finally, the unbearable torture was beginning to subside.<br><br>I slowly sat up on the bed. The creaks and squeaks of the old mattress frame protested loudly from my loud movements.<br><br>Looking around, I noticed that I was in a room. I didn't recognise this room. Despite that, I felt a sense of familiarity here.<br><br>Gently getting off the bed, I stumbled and fell face first onto the ground.<br><br>The thump was loud. A loud groan emerged from above me. It appeared that I was sleeping in a bunk bed.<br><br>I ignored the person's groan. I was more surprised than hurt from the fall.<br><br>Slowly getting up, I looked down at my body. My arms and legs were strangely small.<br><br>It felt really strange. My body felt too small. Yet somehow, I knew it was my body. It was that strange sense of familiarity again.<br><br>Sighing gently, I made my way to a mirror and took a good look at my reflection.<br><br>I was met with the body of a child. A handsome child, but a child nonetheless.<br><br>There were rather striking features on me, namely, my spiky, red hair and my similarly coloured eyes.<br><br>I slowly sighed. I had a bad premonition about this.<br><br>I turned around to look at the person in the bed above mine. He was beginning to wake up and I could tell that he was around 9 years old.<br><br>The pain in my head was all but gone now, but my memories were still fuzzy at the moment.<br><br>"Hey Huang Yu, you ok there bud?"<br><br>A sleepy voice came from the boy on the bed. He sat upright, but his eyes were only half open.<br><br>I looked at him silently for a few moments, trying to recognise his face. The fuzz in my brain was beginning to clear up.<br><br>I still had no recollection of this person, yet I had to give an answer. As I collected my thoughts, my mouth began moving on its own.<br><br>"I'm fine Cheng Yan. Just feeling a little bit under the weather right now."<br><br>"I can tell. You look horrible."<br><br>Cheng Yan gave a yawn as he got off the bed. He approached me with his eyes still only half open.<br><br>"Do you want some medicine? I got some antibiotics in my bag."<br><br>"No thanks. I just need rest. Can you tell the teacher that I won't be going to class today?"<br><br>I gave a small smile. I didn't know why I said that, but I decided playing along with my disobedient mouth was the best course of action.<br><br>"Sure bud. No problem. I'll just tell him you got sick. I'm sure he'll understand."<br><br>Cheng Yan gave a drowsy smile before taking a change of clothes.<br><br>I let out a mental sigh. He didn't find anything wrong with my acting. Going with the flow really was the best choice of action there.<br><br>At this point, the fog in my head was lifted and memories, some that should be mine and some that shouldn't, appeared in my head.<br><br>The memories were strange. Some of the memories were of this world. This world was a world of cultivation. People here had martial spiritss and could cultivate to become powerful and influential.<br><br>I could remember my past clearly. I was a child of a merchant family who had gotten lucky during the awakening ceremony. I awakened at Rank 4 and had a decent martial spirit.<br><br>My parents were thrilled at the fact that I could become a Spirit Master, sending me to a Spirit Master academy without my consent.<br><br>I was sent to live at the dorms of the academy, known as Eastsea Academy as my parents lived too far away.<br><br>During my time here, I was an average student. My grades were normal and the cultivation speed was consistent with the others.<br><br>I had spent 3 years at the academy and I didn't really have any friends.<br><br>Cheng Yan was just a roommate.<br><br>A kind one, but still a roommate nevertheless.<br><br>However, there was also another set of memories.<br><br>A set of memories belonging to a person of a different world.<br><br>In that world, there were no Spirit Masters or martial spirits. It wasn't a dog eat dog world, rather a world where there was order.<br><br>I was a normal 25 year old man, working as a politician. I lived a busy life, having a large workload.<br><br>When I was free, I liked reading novels and manga whether they be Japanese, Chinese or Korean ones.<br><br>I was also a practitioner of Taekwondo, having it forced upon me by my parents at a young age.<br><br>'It was for self-defense' they said.<br><br>I didn't really resent them for it as I quite enjoy Taekwondo as well.<br><br>As the memories flow through my head, I let out a flinch. holding my head as I could feel a headache forming.<br><br>Noticing this, Cheng Yan came and supported me as he helped me get back to my bed. With a look of worry on his face, he tried to advise me,<br><br>"Huang Yu, I think you should get a doctor." Cheng Yan was speaking seriously at the moment.<br><br>"Rest assured, I'll be better after a bit of rest. Just go out. When you come back, I'll be as good as new." I reassured him with a smile. Cheng Yan frowned and moved to the door.<br><br>"If you say so. In that case, I'll be off now. I'll go eat breakfast." Cheng Yan waved a goodbye as he left the room.<br><br>I close my eyes and sigh. I was sorting through my memories.<br><br>The first day of class would be tomorrow so I could relax for now.<br><br>After a few moments of contemplation, I had come to a conclusion.<br><br>I had been transmigrated to another world. This cruel world where the strong devoured the weak and where one could die anytime at the whims of others.<br><br>To survive, I needed strength. I had to gain it, in order to protect my own life.<br><br>At this moment, I, Huang Yu, a normal person in my past life, a child in my current life, let out another sigh.<br><br>This new life… how troublesome...<br>`,

She licked his ears and whisper<br><br>Eimi: need some help with that?<br><br>While placing her hands at his dick that is now making a tent inside his shorts.<br><br>Kuro: why are you doing this?<br><br>Eimi: no sex for 3 years and every time i ask my husband he always says he is tired. So when I saw your penis getting hard for me I just couldn't control my self.<br><br>Eimi said while a little ashamed.<br><br>Kuro said nothing after that and leaned for a kiss. Eimi who is pretty horny right now kissed back and their hands roamed each others body. By the time they broke the kiss eimi was already very wet.<br><br>They removed their clothes fast, eimi then passed a condom to him, he didn't need it plus the size is too small it will break but still wore the tight battle armor and they kissed again while Kuro positions his dick at her very moist pussy. He kept on rubbing the tip at the entrance. Eimi broke the kiss and said "Fuck me! Now!" Kuro said nothing and just shoved his dick inside her pussy making her moan loudly "AHHNN~".<br><br>-30mins of Loud moans and flesh slapping-<br><br>Kuro: I am cumming Fukuda-san! 'the condom already broke' he thought.<br><br>Kuro painted her insides white while eimi felt her biggest orgasm drowning her in ecstasy.<br><br>Kuro took a shower and went out to buy some condoms. He bought 3 boxes and went back. They had sex again and again their only rest when they needed to eat or felt sleepy but their sleep only lasted 1 hour and they resumed thier debauchery.<br><br>He did not think that 3 boxes would be used within a day. He was already on his way back. He didn't notice a billboard with the latest model of a truck printed on it falling on top of him.<br><br>People around him tried to shout at him but it was already too late. The billboard was 10 inches above him by the time he looked up. All he saw was a truck. He didn't even know it was a billboard.<br><br>The r-18 is for practice has no connection to the story. Past lives are for experience so he won't be a noob at the start since I plan to make him OP.<br>`,

Kurama said.<br><br>Standing in the ruins of the home of his ancestors. Naruto stood in front of the gate with its doors covered in writing. He wore a dark orange jacket over a black long sleeve shirt. He also wore a modified black anbu pants with multiple pockets and a pair of brown boots. His long bright blond hair is covered by the hood of his jacket.<br><br>After the defeat of Kaguya Otsutsuki, a short period of peace has been observed in the Elemental Nations. Countries and Hidden Villages alike are working hand in hand to recover from the disasters caused by the Fourth Great Shinobi War. But of course, it wouldn't last long.<br><br>Everybody knew it. It only takes a single spark of human greed and hates to reverse all the progress achieved.<br><br>Nobody knew better how fickle human nature is than Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze. The last heir of the Senju and Uzumaki clans from his mother's side, Kushina Uzumaki, and the last heir of the Namikaze clan and member of the Uchiha clan from his father's side, the Yondaime Hokage Minato Namikaze.<br><br>As a kid, Naruto has always been the target of hate by the citizens of Konoha due to his unique circumstances. He was chosen as the jinchuuriki of the Kyuubi by his own father after it escaped from its previous vessel, his mother. Naruto was raised ignorant from his own heritage by the order of the Sandaime Hokage, Hiruzen Sarutobi. Naruto became the target of scorn and hatred of the ignorant masses due to him being the prison of the Kyuubi. Only recently has this outlook been changed due to his role in the Fourth Shinobi War and the defeat of Kaguya Otsutsuki.<br><br>Tired of the cycle of hatred, Naruto trained hard to overcome the challenges that the path to peace would face. He became the foremost master of Fuinjutsu, acquired the ultimate dojutsu RinneTenseiSharingan, or simply called Shinigan, became the first full sage, and acquired the Takigakure's famed kinjutsu, the Jiongu all after the war. He also set out to allow himself to become the jinchuuriki of the nine bijuu. Shukaku, Matatabi, Isobu, Son Gokū, Kokuō, Saiken, Chōmei, Gyūki, and Kurama. This would ensure that the power of the bijuu wouldn't be abused by any hidden village and would allow some form of freedom to the bijuu due to his modified Death God Seal that allows partial autonomy of the bijuu inside the seal.<br><br>An unforeseen side effect of all the power he acquired was that he became essentially immortal. An overreaction to his predicament, he decided to leave the world he has known and live a relatively normal life in another world. He dedicated his knowledge of fuinjutsu and near limitless amount of chakra in his disposal, be created a bridge to another world.<br><br>Packing up everything he would need and saying one last goodbye to the only world he has known, the 21-year-old Naruto, the hero of the Elemental Nations, left the world in a flash of light so bright it rivaled the sun, without so much as a goodbye to his friends and families.<br><br>-Central Park, New York, USA, 2005-<br><br>"That is the worst Hiraishin EVER!" Naruto shouted with a fervor<br><br>"Shut up! If it's bad for you, how about for us in here!" Chomei replied with equal enthusiasm.<br><br>"I guess its a success since we're not dead" Gyuuki added with mirth<br><br>"Kit, we need to get out of here. We may have attracted some unwanted attention with our exit" Kurama advised<br><br>"Yeah, yeah. I'm going. Sheesh" Naruto said<br><br>Applying suppression seals on his nape to cover his chakra signature, he left the scene in as much speed and stealth he could muster without chakra enhancements. Hiding in the shadows of the trees around him, he noticed there are paths and structures in the forest. On second thought, it's not a forest but a large park.<br><br>"Who the hell makes a park the size of Konoha." Naruto thought to himself.<br><br>It took 10 seconds for him to reach the clearing of the park. Still hiding from the shadows, Naruto took notice of the world he landed on. What he saw awed and surprised him. Buildings higher than the Hokage Monument everywhere, carriages running without horses or ox, bright lights that reach for the sky and people, lots and lots of people. All were looking towards where he came from.<br><br>"Holy shit" Isobu drawled out.<br><br>"Imagine climbing one of those." Son Goku blurted out.<br><br>"You're really just big monkey, aren't you." Kokuo teased.<br><br>"We need a base of operations while we figure out how this world works." Saiken said.<br><br>"Yeah. Let me try something. I feel we are still not far enough from where we came." Naruto said.<br><br>Getting Hiraishin kunai from his pocket, he threw it hard at a 45-degree angle to maximize distance and to miss any buildings in its immediate path. When he felt the kunai stopped, he asked Kurama, "Any people near where that kunai landed?"<br><br>"None from what I can tell." Kurama replied.<br><br>With a flash of light, he's gone.<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>In an attic in New York, the lights of the sun reflected by the tinted windows of the various skyscrapers gave the polished, marble black countertops an almost iridescent quality. The spacious attic, however, for all its beauty, seemed empty, the surfaces bare and no decorations in sight save for a smattering of weapons anchored to the walls. This set-up could be described as Spartan at best, all furniture clearly high-end, yet all in either black or white. In continuum with the colour scheme, in a king-sized bed with simple yet luxurious white sheets a silhouette could be made out.<br><br>The defined contour of his figure made him appear as skinny - almost sickly so, and yet, if one glanced at his face, the striking face that one would observe could only be described in one way: angelic. The peaceful aspects of his sleeping face give him an almost ethereal quality - as if he may be broken if woken up too harshly. The inky black hair that contoured his face seemed to have a life of its own, radiating in its absence of colour. The boy lay there peacefully, breathing in and out in a measured manner.<br><br>Suddenly, breaking the idyllic image, the boy woke up and groaned:<br><br>He stretched, thin arms in which the elbow protruded profusely, he let out a long, tiresome sigh and muttered: "Another day, huh.". It all seemed well, and yet suddenly, he opened his eyes and let out: "The pain! It's gone!".<br><br>He remembered, the chronic pain he had suffered from since the accident had made his life hell. At his young 13 years of age, he had gone through more pain than people usually went through in 50 lifetimes. The car accident he had been in was the cause of this, 10 years of hell, and he could hardly remember the cause. All he knew was that a drunk driver (now apprehended by the authorities), had crashed a stolen oil rig into the car that had contained his whole family, him, his older sister, his mother and the driver - his father. He remembered nothing from that day and the weeks that followed, you would assume that he would, considering it was the event that marked the death of his family, and yet all he could picture of those moments was the pain.<br><br>It was as if someone had been tearing at his insides, from his most delicate nerve endings to the most robust bones in his body. Now, the boy felt none of that, he simply felt peace, peace and the pleasure of being alive.<br>`,

		chapter: `Several corpses were found scattered on the ground, the once joyous streets drowned in the silence of the night.<br><br>Next to the corpse of a woman, there was a kneeling child hugging a corpse with his hands covered in blood.<br><br>"Mommy, why don't you move?! .. Mommy!"<br><br>Tears ran down the boy's face, although the boy already knew that his mother was dead, he did not want to accept it.<br><br>After several attempts to wake her up, despair could be seen on the boy's face and then something happened, an incredible headache attacked him, clutching his head with his hands, his eyes drenched in tears, those eyes black as night began to change, his right eye was changing to scarlet red, there was a small sign of a black tail in it, while his left eye was changing to a golden color, manifesting in it an inorganic looking watch, the hands of the watch pointing directly towards XII .<br><br>After the change occurred, the pain lessened until it disappeared. Taking a breath the boy rubs his hand on his face.<br><br>Withdrawing his bloodstained hand from his mother the boy muttered.<br><br>"I understand ... I remember everything"<br><br>Saying these words the boy once again turned his head towards the body of his mother, again the tears ran down his face.<br><br>"Mom, I'm going to get back at you ... I promise I'll make those who did this pay to you!"<br><br>Looking up at the crimson moon, he slightly closed his eyes.<br><br>With a slight sigh he slowly opened his eyes<br><br>Muttering these words, her small body was covered with darkness along with a clock sound, after a few seconds her clothes were replaced by a jet black hood with crimson patterns, black pants also with crimson patterns combined with long black boots.<br><br>"I'll be back mom" like an illusion his body was swallowed by the darkness, leaving the streets in silence once more.<br><br>"Who are you cursed !?"<br><br>Screams of pain and curses could be heard, the corpses continued to accumulate thus forming pools of blood, however despite all this the masked man did not care.<br><br>"Die cursed!" Said a man whose scarlet red eyes glowed in the dark, brandishing his katana, cut at the masked man.<br><br>An evil smile formed on his face, imagining himself cutting the murderer out of his wife.<br><br>However despite having the time to dodge, the masked man simply let the gun cut him off, the look in his eyes was as if he saw a dead man.<br><br>Once the katana touched his body it simply pierced him, astonishment showed in the scarlet-eyed man.<br><br>"It's useless" said the masked man launched like this, a kunai towards the heart of the man<br><br>"Ha" Releasing a tired sigh, the masked man continued walking without caring about the corpses that he left behind.<br><br>"I hope Itachi finishes soon"<br><br>As if he were responding to those words, the masked man stopped walking.<br><br>In front of the masked man a small figure dressed in black and red emerged from the darkness.<br><br>"This is a surprise, I could barely detect you"<br><br>"Damn you bastard!" Said the boy turning the moonlight on his face, his eyes shining with hatred.<br><br>"Hmm" putting his hand on his chin the masked man looked at the small figure with interest, he could clearly see that the stranger with the strange dress was a boy, however that is not what interested him, but rather his eyes, At an early age the sharingan was awakened in one of his eyes, but that is not what interested him the most but rather his golden left eye.<br><br>The masked man could see the hatred in that look, but he still didn't care.<br><br>"It's a shame, but I have to kill him" said the masked man, while he shook his head at him even though he seemed tough to kill him he didn't really care<br><br>"How dare you damn it! ... Die!"<br><br>Holding a kunai the boy started running to stab the masked man<br><br>Seeing that the masked man shook his head and just waited and just like the previous man, the boy dared his body<br><br>To see that he went through his body, the boy walked a little before he fell, you could see a kunai go through his body.<br><br>"What a shame" the masked man muttered before continuing to walk but.<br><br>The sound of two gunshots was heard at night.<br><br>The bullets went through the body of the masked man causing them to stop his steps, the masked man turned his head and looked in one direction.<br><br>Standing on the roof was a boy holding a strange weapon, seeing this the masked man widened his eyes, surprised, not because of the strange weapon, but rather because it was the boy whom he just killed.<br><br>Turning my head back slightly, I notice that the child's corpse had disappeared.<br><br>"Genjutsu?" he immediately thought it was an illusion, but at the same time he also discarded the idea, being a possessor of the sharingan it is impossible that caught in a genjutsu, such a feat was not possible for someone of the kage level much less a child. Then there is the fact that he had felt that he pierced the child's body with the kunai, adding to this further confusion.<br><br>"What's going on?" Said the masked man before looking back at the boy.<br><br>"My bullets won't work" said the boy, sweating accumulating on his forehead.<br><br>"My chakra is running out fast"<br><br>Gritting his teeth tightly the boy raised his voice<br><br>"You fucking bastard! Why don't you die !?"<br><br>"If you want to kill me, you will have to do better than this" said the masked man showing interest, he really wanted to know what had happened a moment ago,<br><br>(Maybe it's his Dojutsu? ... No, he has barely awakened the sharingan)<br><br>He putting a hand on his chin looked at the boy with interest, thinking that if he looked closely at the boy next time he would understand, so he decided to provoke him.<br><br>"Well, is that all? Little mouse"<br><br>(Damn! I've almost depleted my chakra ..)<br><br>Wiping the sweat on his forehead the boy breathed heavily<br><br>(Well, I'll have to use that ... even if I can't kill him, I'll at least cut off one of his arms!.)<br><br>Raising one of his arms to the sky, a shadow left his body and continued to expand until it reached a diameter of 200 meters.<br><br>Looking with the sharingan, the masked man could see that a gigantic shadow came out of his body and thus mixed around him.<br><br>Although he could dodge he did not do so as he was curious about what he was doing, furthermore he also thought that a child whose chakra was almost empty did not pose a threat.<br><br>Undeterred, the masked man kept looking at the boy, with a calm look, but that did not last long, since he noticed that the boy's chakra point grew and continued to grow.<br><br>"Interesting" although it looked like a kind of chakra or seal absorbing Ninjusto like the legendary Sannin, although it was weird due to a child using it, it was not that impressive<br><br>(But ... why does my body feel different?)<br><br>Noticing something strange in his body the masked man raised his guard<br><br>Opening his eyes in shock the masked man once more.<br><br>"It's stealing my chakra!"<br><br>"Looks like you figured it out, well it wasn't that difficult after all"<br><br>A cruel smile formed on the boy's face.<br><br>"Now get ready to die you bastard! ...

Why is it my job to seal them back?!

He is now 18 years old, and for the past 5 years he would lay in his bed, unable to do anything else besides just laying there; it was a gruesome and unimaginable life that one wouldn't even dare to imagine themselves in.<br><br>However, for this young man who has spent more than half of his life living in a world void of light, he was able to continue living without giving in to despair because of his caring younger sister, who supported him every day without any complaints.<br><br>"So this is the world's first VRMMORPG with 100% immersion, huh."<br><br>When he first heard of the game from his younger sister, he almost couldn't believe it.<br><br>A game that operates inside the mind of the individual, allowing that person to live in another world without the need to move a single limb — who would believe that such an incredible and advanced technology could exist? Not to mention that this high-tech technology was announced to be affordable enough for even the most common families to enjoy.<br><br>It was unimaginable at first, but experiencing it firsthand, the young man can only believe it.<br><br>The countdown continued to lower as the young man tries to familiarize himself with the feeling of moving his limbs. Although it was difficult at first, even tripping after every few steps, he gradually became familiarized with his body again.<br><br><Welcome to Cultivation Online!><br><br>As the system's notice appeared, the black space quickly brightened, becoming a bright white room. And right before the young man, a crack appeared out of thin air, looking like a glass window being cracked.<br><br>The crack grew larger and larger — until it was large enough for an adult to fit.<br><br>Suddenly, the large crack broke apart entirely, revealing the darkness behind it, and a beautiful woman with a graceful and elegant body slowly walked out from within the cracked space, looking like a goddess appearing from another world.<br><br>"This is…" The young man could only watch in a daze as the beautiful woman who just came out of the cracked space began looking at him from top to bottom with a seemingly cold expression on her otherwordly face. Dressed in unfamiliar red and golden robes, her figure was supple and graceful. Her facial features are sharp, symmetrical, and peerless. All in all, she looked like an otherworldly goddess. However, despite all of her perfect features, her gaze was anything but friendly.<br><br>She stared at him with her golden eyes that overflowed with a feeling of dominance, and her aura radiated with a tyrannical power that the young man cannot comprehend.<br><br>"Mortal, place your hand on this." The beauty spoke to him with a cold voice that was fitting for a ruler, and the young man watched as she pulled out a crystal ball from thin air.<br><br>"Okay." Believing that she was an NPC, the young man followed her instructions and placed his hand on the crystal ball without thinking about it too much, and words began appearing inside the crystal ball.<br><br>Physique: Heaven Refining Physique<br><br>"?!?!" The beauty's expression suddenly changed upon seeing the information in the crystal ball, her clear eyes filled with disbelief.<br><br>"Heaven Refining Physique!" Her hands trembled along with the crystal ball in her grasp. "Not to mention his Soul Strength is at the rank of Spirit Warrior despite being only a mortal with no cultivation — No, that is nothing when compared to his physique!"<br><br>The beauty has never been this shocked before, even to the point of her body trembling.<br><br>"Is something wrong?" The young man asked her upon seeing her silence and excited expression.<br><br>She lifted her head to look at him, thinking to herself: 'I must rope him into joining my faction before the others find him…'<br><br>"What is your name?" she asked him with a serious expression.<br><br>"Take this token and keep it with you until we meet next time." The beauty retrieved a jade medallion from thin air and suddenly tossed it to him. "I don't have much time left here. Make sure you don't lose the token, I will see you again."<br><br>"Huh? Wait, I have some..." Before Yuan can even ask her any questions, the beauty walked back into the cracked hole, disappearing alongside the crack in the air.<br><br>"What an odd NPC. What should I do now?" He looked around the empty place.<br><br><Character evaluation complete. Teleportation will occur in 10 seconds.><br><br>As the timer reached zero, Yuan's vision suddenly twisted, giving him a slight headache. When he blinked and opened his eyes, he found himself on some kind of stage where many people that wore the same white robe as him were gathered in a spacious area.<br><br>"This is… Cultivation Online?" His eyes widen when he saw mountains floating in the sky above the clouds and what appeared to be houses built on these floating mountains.<br><br>"Welcome, Mortals! I am Elder Song, in charge of making sure that before you all leave this place and adventure this vast world that you will have a goal of what you want to do here set in your mind." An old man in blue robes suddenly greeted everybody with a booming voice, causing everybody there to look above them.<br><br>"He's flying! He is really flying while standing on that sword!" The people exclaimed the obvious.<br><br>Elder Song smiled and said: "I will answer your questions later, but first, let me explain to you about this world — the world of Cultivation."<br><br>"First and foremost, this is the Heavenly Continent, and we are currently at Mountain #96. Before you were transported here, everyone should have met a representative from our world that gave you an evaluation. That is your character status; it tells you almost everything about yourself."<br><br>"We will start with the basics. In this world, humans and monsters cultivate their bodies and mind with Spirit Qi that allows them to obtain supernatural powers. We call people like them Cultivators, and the higher the cultivation you reach, the stronger you will be in this world. Legacy and Bloodlines are special features that can be obtained later on if you are fortunate enough. As for Physique, everyone here should have one. Whether or not it is useless, this will tell you."<br><br>Elder Song waved his long sleeves and thousands of talisman flew towards the people there.<br><br>"Activate it with your thoughts," said Elder Song.<br><br>The crowd followed his instruction, and loud exclamations resounded soon afterward.<br><br>"It says that I have an Earth-ranked Physique! What does that mean?"<br><br>Elder Song looked at the young man who just spoke and said to him, "There is a one in ten thousand chances one is born with an Earth-rank Physique. Congratulations. You are what we call 'talented'."<br><br>"Elder, how many ranks of Physiques are there?"<br><br>"The rank for Physiques consists of Mortal, Earth, Heaven, and Divine."<br><br>"Elder, what does having a Mortal-rank Physique mean, and what is the difference between the ranks?"<br><br>Elder Song remained silent for a moment, before speaking with a grin, "Having a Mortal Physique means you are only ordinary, but having an Earth Physique means you are talented. The difference is obvious — you are naturally inferior to those who have a better physique than you! The more talented you are, the easier it will be for you as a Cultivator!"<br><br>His words caused many faces to sink, especially those with a Mortal Physique.<br><br>"Can our Physiques be changed?" Someone suddenly asked.<br><br>"Physiques can be changed, but the process is a long and painful one, so most people just accept their fate."<br><br>The people sighed in relief after hearing that their Mortal Physique can be changed.<br><br>"Does anyone here happen to have a Divine rank Physique?" Elder Song's eyes flickered with expectation, but when nobody replied to his question the light in his eyes dimmed.<br><br>'The chances of someone having a Divine Physique is one in a hundred million, a genius above genius that knows no equal, so it isn't surprising that such a prodigy wouldn't appear amongst a mere thousand people.' He shook his head inwardly.<br><br>"Elder, I have a Heaven-ranked Physique." An individual suddenly said out loud, causing everybody there to look at him.<br><br>"Hoh? The chances of a Heaven Physique appearing is one in a million. You are a very fortunate one, young genius. What is your name?"<br><br>"My name is Shen Ming," replied the handsome young man.<br><br>"Shen Ming? Isn't he the eldest son of Shen Li, the CEO of Royal Entertainment?"<br><br>Some people there recognized the handsome young man whose face looked exactly the same as he does in real life.<br><br>"Did you receive something from the representative who did your evaluation?" Elder Song asked him with great interest.<br><br>"Yes, I did." Shen Ming did not hide that fact and told him the truth. "I received this pouch from the representative."<br><br>"Oho… That is a storage pouch used to store items, there may be a few things in there that could benefit you. However, only cultivators are capable of using it. Additionally, if you can meet the person who gave you that gift again, they might even recruit you as a disciple for their Sect."<br><br>"Sect? You mean like guilds?"<br><br>"A Sect is a place created by one or a group of people for the purpose of nurturing its disciples to become powerful Cultivators — a school for Cultivators, basically." Elder Song briefly explained. "Is that it? Does nobody else have a Heaven Physique?"<br><br>After a moment of silence, Elder Song shook his head and thought to himself, 'What a pity that there is only one person out of the thousands here worth investing in. But even then, I don't know who had given him that storage pouch. It'd be rude of me if I were to steal away their target, and I might even offend someone I cannot afford to offend.'<br><br>"I have one question for everybody here before I let you leave… What do you desire to achieve in this world? Strength? Status? Wealth? Handsome men? Beautiful women? Tell me, Mortals from another world!"<br><br>"I want to fly like you!"<br><br>"I want enough money to make a mountain!"<br><br>"I want to walk around with beautiful women in both my arms!"<br><br>"I want handsome men to pamper me!"<br><br>Elder Song smiled upon hearing the masses' desires. "If you want to survive in a world such as this, then you must have power! In this world, the strong rules the weak! Wealth and fame will naturally come if you are strong! People will flock to you if you are strong! Remember my words, young ones — this world looks down on the weak and the inferior, respecting only the strong! Having strength means you have everything!"<br><br>"Who do you think have the most power in this world?" Elder Song glanced at the people below with a narrowed gaze, sending chills down their spine.<br><br>"Cultivators! We, Cultivators, are a symbol of power, wealth, fame, and respect — we are the rule of this world!"<br><br>"Cultivators, is that some sort of class?" The people wondered.<br><br>"Elder, how do I become a Cultivator?"<br><br>Elder Song smiled. "It's simple, really." He suddenly waved his sleeves, and thousands of glowing orbs appeared out of the blue and flew towards the people and directly at their forehead, submerging into their brain.<br><br>"I have just given you all the method to cultivate. It is now up to you to decide whether you want to cultivate or remain as a mortal." Elder Song waved his sleeves again, and four portals appear not too far away from the group. "Each portal represents a Continent. In this world, we have Four Great Continents not including this Heavenly Continent. Once you step inside, it will take you to a place within one of these Four Great Continents randomly, but even I will not know exactly where you'll land so it is up to your fate."<br><br><You have learned: Basic Qi Gathering Techniqiue><br><br><Description: Absorbs 1 Qi every second. Can only be activated when sitting in the lotus position.><br><br>"Now, scram. I have spent too much of my precious time dealing with you mortals. You will learn more about this world as you travel. Even if I use the remaining of my longevity, I won't be able to explain to you everything about this world."<br><br>With another wave of his sleeve, everybody there began flying towards the portal as though they were being pulled towards them.<br><br>Shocked cries resounded, and those who entered the portal would soon appear in this vast and unknown world at random.<br><br>After being thrown into the portal, Yuan felt the slight dizziness again, and before he was aware, he was in the middle of a forest.<br><br>"Where is this? Is there a map I can use?"<br><br>Suddenly, a large map with four large continents separated by water appears before him.<br><br>"Eastern Continent?" That was the only information he could gather from the map. Everything else was blacked out.<br><br>Yuan tilted his head to look at the bright sky and sighed. "I didn't get to ask him about my Physique. That old man said that there only exist four ranks of Physiques: Mortal, Earth, Heaven, and Divine, so why does my Physique not belong to any one of these four ranks? Do I have a special body?"<br><br>In his grasp was a talisman with the following words on it:<br><br><Heaven Refining Physique><br>`,

		chapter: `I was floating madly in a black space without any mass to occupy the place apart from my body, certainly something very interesting, but unfortunately I do not have time to think about this space in which I find myself, since I currently have an existential crisis, Although I can remember my life to a certain extent, I do not remember my name, I know everything that I have lived, seen, studied and I even know by heart all the effort I made to have a better life being born with a talent and physique below average, after all I came into the world without a single talent, and with a weak physique, the doctors doubted if I was alive, according to what my mother said, it was a difficult life.<br><br>Although I was able to make a massive change, both to my physical and psychological aptitudes, I lost a lot in the process and even so I was not the most popular, I still stood out from the rest without having good concentration, without having a good memory and even without being attractive Well, I thank at least that my little brother was above average, but that doesn't matter now. The point is that I don't know my name, my family's names, or those of my acquaintances. What's more, I don't even remember his faces, only the experiences we lived through.<br><br>While I was making an effort to remember my name a light appeared that blinded me for about 10 seconds and a kind of ghost-like being appeared.<br><br>Ser: good boy I see that you have some problems, but I am here to answer your questions as long as they are within my reach.<br><br>Me: well I have a lot of questions right now, but the most important one is, why can't I remember my name or the faces of my acquaintances?<br><br>Be: good boy that is because your mortal life on planet earth has come to an end, and now you are in a reincarnation process, therefore, only the experience you obtained in that world can accompany you, but not the relationships that has done there.<br><br>Me: I understand well you answered that to most of my questions, but still why was I considered for reincarnation? I say I was not superior in anything, in fact my life was pathetic until I finished high school, and for that I had to lose some of my emotions, although I am not crazy, I do not think in the same way as the rest.<br><br>Ser: I know, we saw your entire life up to this point, and that is why boy we chose you for despite being one of the worst if not the worst of your own species, you fought to be someone and although no one expected something from you, nor your own family over time managed to be superior to most of your kind.<br><br>Being: Unlike the majority, you broke your own destiny not wanting to accept your inferiority and although for our eyes that was barely noticed, in your world not even your own family recognized you, that is why we gave you the opportunity to reincarnate in another world. To be honest, most of your species is very conformist, you are the only one who was not satisfied with what you got and wanted more and what I have achieved is why in years you are the next to reincarnate.<br><br>Being: I tell you boy, normally we only reincarnate special people, great geniuses, heroes who saved thousands of lives, even if it was only by coincidence, and we even reincarnate people who massacred thousands of lives, you are a very rare exception.<br><br>He told me that in whispers, I don't know why, but I imagined that he had me by the neck while he whispered that to me, even though I don't currently have a body.<br><br>Me: thank you sir, but actually I have nothing to ask for, I am not lying, I wish only one thing, and that is that in my next life I be someone average, after living in a life of disadvantages I want one in which it is common , as if it were a blank sheet, without advantages, but I do not want disadvantages either. That's why I want to reincarnate into someone average, except for one thing the only thing that was not average I want to keep the size of my little brother.<br><br>Ser: hahaha, sorry for laughing boy but I really did not expect this, after seeing the disadvantages of your life even so you do not want talent if you are not someone averaged, hahaha I really don't know how you think boy but it's okay, I know what world send you, and yes, you are not wrong, I will send you to the world of Komi-san wa komyushou desu as Tadano Hitohito one year before I met Komi Shouko, but before sending you tell me, according to what I saw you are not respectful to anyone, only with those who earn your respect, and it is more you detest beings like me, those who stepped on the sacred ground, because you are so formal and you do not act like those Fanfic characters who believe themselves the last drop of the desert and begin to shout to the gods<br><br>I know that they reincarnate or demand things of them.<br><br>Me: it's simple ... I'm not an idiot, I don't know your character, if just one word of mine makes you angry, I'll be lucky if you just erase my existence, but if you decide to torture me by making me go through hell where they rape everyone I love, or Let them slowly kill in front of me everything I want to protect, I simply will not be able to do anything since from the beginning that was your choice, because you are strong and have the power, you are free to do whatever you want with those who are inferior to you, that of showing myself haughty before an existence like you, only an idiot would do it.<br><br>Ser: Pff ... hahahaha, you're right, you're absolutely right, young man, if only you had acted like that, it would have ended as you thought, I don't understand how they think they have even an ounce of possibility to act so haughty in front of us, hero in a million, boy we took out about 100 million more and looked for another, you were just lucky to fall here, that's what they must think, I'm your entertainment so give me everything I want, boy if you don't accept what I give you I'll entertain myself making you suffer, but not only because they are going to reincarnate they think they are special, that is why lately we have begun to put losers up their sleeves, so that they understand that anyone with great luck can reincarnate.<br><br>Ser: well boy, it's time to say goodbye, but in the future I will send you a gift to enter ... sorry to give more excitement to your life until we meet again boy.<br><br>Me: wait, what problems are you going to give me? Fri ...<br><br>He can't get to curse him since again a light blinded me, although he gave me the life I wanted, I am 100% sure that it would ruin my quiet life, I suppose I should say goodbye to my peaceful life, or I should take advantage of the calm and relax Until your gift arrives, who am I kidding, it's time to break your bones while I'm calm, because I won't want to die when the storm comes, if you wonder why I wanted to curse it despite what we talked about being haughty, it's simple I saw that I caught his emotion, that's why he won't let me curse him.<br><br>When I open my eyes again, the first thing I notice is a shared room. How do I know? I know why the bed is a cabin and I see girl's clothes lying around it, and if I have already noticed that I was not reborn as a girl, in passing I tell you that my little brother really accompanied me. Well if I really reincarnated that means that I am Tadano Hitohito a year before the canon, well it is 5:00 am at the moment I am reviewing the memories of this body so as not to seem a complete stranger to my family, well do not look for the memories , once, let's say that once my soul connected 100% with the body, in this case, Tadano's body, not only brought me suddenly the memories of his life but also his experiences, which in fact has , but still not save me from the headache that caused me to receive so much information.<br><br>Well from what I was able to rescue from the memories of this body is that my life was actually average, I do not have a complaint with the body, and although I wanted a quiet life I should train as before, I should not train harder, if before I didn't stop until my muscles screamed, now I won't stop until I hear my bones creak, after all I don't know what mess that BEING will get me into later.<br><br>If I had known this, I would have asked for a fucking system, but he did not let me even curse him, but hey, I know that whatever my life has put me at risk, so to train it has been said, the good thing is that This guy only has Osana Najimi as a friend, since this guy in high school suffered from the eighth grade disease, Chūnibyō. Hito hasn't seen him since high school, after that disastrous rejection he suffered, of which Najimi was the only witness so he took him away, and it was also that day he decided never to stand out, well until he met Komi-san Well, enough to think about the past Milestone it's time to get out of here.<br><br>I left in silence so as not to wake up my family and I went to a distant park by bicycle, I did not want them to know about my training since they will ask the reasons for my change in routine and that is really a pain to explain to them, there is back in my Past life yes they were very heavy and negative before my efforts to change even my family, or capable was too stubborn, now that I think about it because of the condition for my body I felt so frustrated that on the fifth day of training I did, I I went overboard and ended up hospitalized for a whole week, it really sucked to be me, but hey this is a new life and I don't want to think about it too much, it's good that I have a better body, despite not having a talent that facilitates growth, is also free from disadvantages that interrupt my growth.<br><br>In my previous life I underwent all kinds of training, memorization, calisthenics, yoga, martial arts, music, cooking, art, etc. I have all of them in my brain since the BEING Mysteriously, he said that he would reincarnate with them, but what is missing now is physical training, while all my memories and experiences have accompanied me up to this point, my body has not, therefore, I must reinforce it, recover muscle memory through training.<br><br>In research about the human body that I used to strengthen myself, I discovered that the best muscle to train were pink muscles, since these were not only firm, but also very flexible, which is why they were perfect for martial arts.<br><br>Although transforming all your muscles to pink muscles was difficult, exhausting and even painful, it was not impossible since it took me about 3 years to obtain them, but that was my lack of talent and that I also had to divide my time to learn the other things, but now that I only have to worry about my physique and my muscular memory, I trust that one year is more than enough for the concretion of my muscles to pink muscles and to strengthen me, let's see how much this body can hold up.`,

The protagonist said with raised eyebrow he was weirded out as hell! looking at oneself in the mirror is one thing, but looking at the person who looks just like you is something completely different experience!<br><br>"Because I am you…more precisely I am one version of you who was lucky enough to be rewarded with the chance to experience Cultivation world…" Hearing that he quickly put things together what is going on.<br><br>"You have reached the peak then?" Only very powerful beings can invade one's mind…or he is getting delusion…<br><br>"Hmm… that what I like about myself, you catch on quick…and no, you are not delusional…Being at the top is utterly boring alone. So, that's why I came here, I decided to help my other self, as you can probably guess, the multiverse is very real, and I have decided to give you… some power…" After saying that, The Protagonist world turned from white to pitch black, as he felt like sleepiness has claimed him.<br><br>The next morning when he woke up, he thought he was dreaming of that encounter, after all, there was nothing to indicate that this event happened.<br><br>No weird feeling, no alterations to his body, no mental powers, and he was, of course, still in his bed.<br><br>After checking himself up, he got up from his bed, and noticed that there was a white envelope on his table, he slowly picked it up and opened it.<br><br>[I know you going to think that what you saw is just a dream and you simply going to forget it, about our encounter. So, as a reminder I left this small message.]<br><br>[Let me explain what is the power I gave you. First, I gave you power of universe…] He raised his eyebrow reading this line.<br><br>[That means that inside of you there is a 'Universe' where you can create whatever comes to your mind. It, of course, has limitations as your body is the 'gate' to this universe, the stronger the gate the bigger the things you can pull out from your 'Universe'] He took a deep breath reading this.<br><br>[Another thing… since our home universe is boring, I am giving you the power to travel through the multiverse…] With that he finished reading the message…<br><br>He took a step back and collapsed back into his bed, he was shell-shocked what he just read.<br><br>"As expected of myself… he didn't even explain how to use this power…" after some time he finally spoke.<br><br>The first thing which came to his mind, is to close his eyes and imagine something, the first thing he did was darkness, then he imagined a can of Coke, and then he imagined it appearing in his hand…<br><br>He then tried again, this time with more details, but it didn't work…<br><br>He then tried imagining Galaxy… white room… then a factory…<br><br>Then he got an idea, since it's his counterpart who gave him this power, he decided to try something completely different…<br><br>He imagined a trigger of sorts, first starting with Gun pulling a trigger, followed by a thunderclap…<br><br>Something inside of him just…clicked! The next thing he then did was imagining a can of coke, and then he made it appear in his hand!<br><br>The next moment he felt it! Something cold appeared in his hand!<br><br>When he opened his eyes he saw a can of classic coke in his hand, but then tiredness washed him over.<br><br>'I am tired already? Is this he after effect of using this power?' Realizing that he is going need to fix that as soon as possible!<br><br>But for now, he decided to taste if the coke in this can taste the same as the ones he buys from the store!<br><br>With a loud click, the can got opened and he tasted the drink.<br><br>"Hmm, a perfect coke! Awesome!" <br><br>After drinking it he decided to rest, as his body was tired after that single use of his power.<br><br>What left to do in this situation is to check out his phone, as always the first thing he does is to check the news, not the world news! He hates all the bullshit politics and all the nonsense it comes with it, no! He checks out news on anime, games, and manga…<br><br>After checking that, he goes on another news section, this one is a little bit different as it only has updates on novels and it's translation statuses.<br><br>His gaze found an update on one of his novels he checks from time to time, Against The Gods is something he read from time to time but he started to dislike the whole plot drama…<br><br>The disappearances of MC and then his timely appearances when he is needed the most, while at first he liked it… But, it got repetitive and annoying…<br><br>So, he started reading the newest update, what started to annoy him again is that stupid Dark Che personality, and how Ying'er has to guide him by hand like some small child…<br><br>Just reading this makes him want to go there as slap him with a baseball bat! <br><br>But, then that moment he felt it!<br><br>Like some sort of power, which he feels he can do it!!!

Besides...he wants to mess with the whole plot!<br><br>No! He will got there when everything just started and replace Yun Che! That all Drama bullshit is just annoying to Him!<br><br>So, he started to think about how he can do this? How can he replace that moron?<br><br>So, eventually, he came up with a method, it's a longshot! he decided to take over his body…<br><br>After thinking a few moments he opened the second chapter of the series, and used that feeling he had before…<br><br>He felt like he was transported somewhere else, as if travelling through some sort of a space…<br><br>When he opened his eyes, he was no longer in his room… no he was in some sort Chinese themed room, the whole place is decorated in red, with Phoenix symbolism…<br><br>He was now in Xiao Che room! and he saw the guy dressed in red laying in the bed, he felt some sort of shift is happening to Xiao Che, he could only smirk as he walked over to him, and put his hand on this lanky looking guy, he looked like a female with that long hair, and tender looking skin…<br><br>Forgetting about Xiao Che looks for a moment, he activated his power, he pulled Xiao Che or is it, Yun Che? soul into his 'Universe' where he quickly imagined it to be transformed into experience cards with no personality, and then he imagined transferring himself into his body…<br><br>Moments later, darkness took over him, and when he opened his eyes, he felt like he was laying on the bed.<br><br>What baffled him is how much stronger he felt…<br><br>'Xiao Che is only [First of Elementary Profound] yet he is stronger than my other body!!!' The newly minted Xiao Che quickly moved out of his bed and looked at the body laying down on the floor, He put his hand on it, and took a deep breath.<br><br>'Here goes nothing!' He imagined pulling this body in his Universe, He instantly felt the drain on his stamina, he felt quite tired, but it's Wonderful!<br><br>He slowly got up on his feet, this crazy mission was a success, something he was quite sceptical it's going to work, but it did and now he can enjoy and experience this universe to its fullest!<br><br>Xiao Che looked at his left hand, there was a green tattoo on it, his hand then moved towards his neck the felt a necklace on it…<br><br>'Yep… starting with two Heavenly treasures is something else…' Thinking with a smirk he then accessed his 'Universe' and pulled several cards, which looked like they were ripped off from the Yu-Gi-Oh franchise.<br><br>'Right… let's see…' going through several cards, he discarded several of them instantly, like Yun Che pride, or his brashness, same with Xiao Che wimp attitude.<br><br>'Ah, yes there it is…' he found what he was looking for, Xiao Che found Yun Che medical training, those were several cards actually, from acupuncture to scalper training… everything was there…<br><br>He then activated these cards and with a bright flash, he felt new information invading his mind.<br><br>"Fuck…that one hurt!" Xiao Che said with a hiss. But, then his eyes widened, remembering something important!<br><br>He quickly went through his cards and found something extremely important!<br><br>Xiao Che quickly activated this card and more information invade his mind, he can now speak fluently in this reality language!<br><br>'Thank God, I didn't mess up this early!'<br><br>Returning to his bed for a second, Xiao Che decided to rest for a moment, as he has a slight migraine, and he still needs to adjust to this new body, as it feels like he is wearing some tight clothes…<br><br>His break didn't last very long as moments later a girl dressed in green clothes rushed into his room.<br><br>"Little Che you finally awake! You got me so worried! Collapsing so suddenly like this!!!" The girl rushed to his side, the New Xiao Che can easily see that this girl is over the heel for the old Xiao Che, pity that the New Xiao Che doesn't like her or Su Ling'er, but it doesn't mean he wasn't going to be nice to them.<br><br>"I am fine little aunt, look!" Xiao Che jumped out from his bed.<br><br>"I feel all rested now!" Xiao Che said with vigour, Lingxi quickly nodded with a smile, she was happy that nothing happened to Xiao Che, pity that she will never know what truly happened to Xiao Che.<br><br>The seven Heavenly Treasure made sure to that, Xiao Che always wondered how none of his family members noticed changes to Xiao Che character after Yun Che replaced him, or more precisely returned to.<br><br>He can only thing that it was Samsara Mirror, who did that…<br><br>Lingxi quickly led Xiao Che to other room where his Grandfather and Doctor Situ was there waiting for him.<br><br>"Che'er how are you feeling?" Old man Xiao Lie asked him.<br><br>"I am feeling fine Grandpa." Xiao Che said with a smile, the old man nodded at him, and motioned for Doctor Situ to check him out.<br><br>The doctor only checked his pulse.<br><br>Something which baffled Earthling inside Xiao Che, while he knows from Yun Che experience that truly genius doctors only need to check pulse to find out what is going on, he doubts this 'Doctor' has such thing…<br><br>"He is fine fifth elder, I believe it was stress that he is marrying today…" Doctor Situ said with slight distaste in his voice.<br><br>Xiao Che internally smirked at this man, in a few days this old man will have different thoughts, not that Xiao Che is interested in what this old man is going to think.<br><br>Xiao Lie nodded hearing the Doctor's diagnosis, he then looked at his grandson.<br><br>"Che'er, will you go inside the carriage or you going to pick a horse?" Hearing this question Xiao Che was in a pickle…<br><br>Because he never ride a horse before…<br><br>"I will pick the horse grandpa…" Hearing his answer Xiao Lie eyes widened for fraction of a second.<br><br>When everyone left outside Xiao Che quickly returned with the excuse that he needed something to get.<br><br>He, of course, went back to his room and pulled out his deck of cards, and found horseback riding, he quickly activated this card, and a new experience assaulted his mind.<br><br>After waiting a few seconds he was ready…<br>`,

		chapter: `<br><br>"Hey!!! Will you be able to take another round? " A young man looking 23 or 24 asked while holding a glass of beer.<br><br>"Let's drink more !!!! This is our university graduation night !!! " A young woman commented. She was also holding a glass of beer and rocking from side to side. She was already drunk.<br><br>"We are going to drink a few more rounds. Barman, can you bring us another round?" Another young man replied. He lifted the empty glass and asked for another round.<br><br>"It's coming soon" The barman saw the glass raised and went to get more beer.<br><br>"This is the happiest day of our lives !!! We finally finished college and graduated"<br><br>"Yes. After today, each of us will have our own jobs "<br><br>"Were you accepted in your work?"<br><br>"I passed the company's tests and was officially hired"<br><br>"I had some problems with my supervisor, but my uncle is the general manager of the company. So there should be no problems "<br><br>"It must be great to have a relative within the company to receive a recommendation"<br><br>"Hehe ... I'm just lucky"<br><br>"What are you going to do from now? I am thinking of traveling a bit to rest "<br><br>"I am thinking of going home and visiting my parents. My work only starts next week "<br><br>"I need to work tomorrow. The company is being very demanding with newbies"<br><br>"Dear customers, here are the beers" The barman arrived with three more large glasses of beer.<br><br>"A cheers to our graduation !!!" The three young people cheer each other before drinking the glass in one go.<br><br>The bar was full of university graduates. The dream of all of them was finally fulfilled. The graduation.<br><br>Tonight was the day to drink until they forget their name.<br><br>The group continued drinking until they didn't know what time it was. Thus, they could only take a taxi or go to a hotel to sleep in.<br><br>Inside a hotel room next to the bar…<br><br>A young man opened his eyes slowly. He suddenly felt a great headache.<br><br>"Ahhh… What happened? Why is my head hurting so much? " The young man shook his head because of the pain. His blurred vision was clear seconds later.<br><br>"Hmm ..." The young man put his hand to the side and felt something soft. In the same instant, he heard a seductive moan.<br><br>"!!!!!!!!" The young man tensed when he heard the moan. He swallowed some saliva and looked to the side.<br><br>(A beautiful girl !!!!!!!) The young man shouted mentally.<br><br>He never saw this girl before, but she was very beautiful. Although her body was not sexy and hot, she was beautiful and refined with the right proportions for each part of her body.<br><br>The young man pressed a few more times to make sure what he was seeing was real.<br><br>"Hmmm ..." The girl beside him moaned again. She was taking pleasure in his touches.<br><br>(What is happening ??? !!!!!!!!!!! What did I do last night ????? !!!!) The young man was shocked by this sudden event.<br><br>Last night's scenes started to pop into his mind.<br><br>(I remember I was drinking beer at the bar with my friends until I almost passed out. After we decided to leave, I was walking alone looking for a hotel to spend the night. What happened in that alley ?? I remember that I was walking through a dark alley and some people were wearing black clothes and hats talking. When they saw me, I passed out. Ahhh ...) The young man tried to remember things from last night, but soon after, he felt a headache.<br><br>(This pain ... It seems that someone hit me very hard yesterday) The young man was in pain because of a blow.<br><br>"Did you woke up?" The beautiful young woman opened her eyes, they were beautiful and look like two shiny gems. She stood up and stretched out her arms.<br><br>"Who are you?" The young man did not know what was happening and how it happened.<br><br>"Have you already forgotten? Our night was quite wild. I didn't imagine that a thin person like you would be so willing, even though you were so drunk" The young woman did not seem to care about the young man's words, but she spoke resentfully and coquettishly. It looked like she was completely satisfied after a long and wild night.<br><br>"..." The young man did not comment on her words and was silent.<br><br>"You don't have to worry about what happened last night. What happened, has already happened. Besides, we have a few hours before we part ways. Ohh... It looks like you are ready again" The young woman looked coquettishly towards the young man. <br><br>"What are you doing?" The young man felt great pleasure when the young woman starts her service. He even closed his eyes to enjoy the pleasure he was receiving.<br><br>"I'm doing what I was paid to do." The young woman said before opening her mouth. <br><br>"Hmmm ..." The young man was feeling like he was in heaven, he couldn't take a minute of pleasure before he exploded.<br><br>"Thank you for the meal" The young woman licked her lips. <br><br>"It tastes as good as it did last night. Do you want to continue? We still have three more hours to go. "The young woman looked at a watch and commented. She makes it look like she was a call girl paid by the young man for pleasure.<br><br>"Did I pay you to spend the night with me?" The young man did not remember doing such a thing.<br><br>"Your friends who paid me. You don't have to worry about that. Just enjoy the time until the end." The young woman whispered in the young man's ears.<br><br>She stood up and her body was fully shown.<br><br>"Beautiful" The young man couldn't help but praise. He had never seen such a beautiful girl in person.<br><br>"I'm happy for the compliment" <br><br>"Let's enjoy this precious time" The young woman whispered in the young man's ear before kissing his lips. <br><br>"Yes ..." The young man's eyes suddenly became lifeless. He looked hypnotized or something else. <br><br>The pair did activities for three hours before stoped.<br><br>"What's happening?" The young man felt like he was being carried by something or someone. But he didn't know what it was.<br><br>His vision was blurred and he couldn't see anything.<br><br>"It looks like he's still conscious" A distorted voice was heard.<br><br>"This is interesting ..." Another person commented.<br><br>"Who are you?" The young man did not know what was happening, he just knew that someone was talking about him.<br><br>"Sleep well" The young man felt two soft, sweet lips pressing against his lips. The young man closed his eyes and slept.<br><br>"Take him to the designated place."<br><br>"It looks like you had a very busy night. You even took it easy on him "<br><br>"I can only say that he was very good in bed. Do you want some too?"<br><br>"No, thank you. I don't want to be in the place of those who are devoured by you "<br><br>"Hehe ... I would love to meet another candidate like him in the future"<br><br>"I'm afraid this is going to be difficult"<br><br>"Let's go back. Transport will begin "<br><br>"I'm looking forward to seeing what he does there."<br><br>"Me too. Someone capable of satisfying you in bed is not just anybody "<br><br>"The Dark Continent. The Prison Continent. The place where sinners and unlucky are taken"<br><br>What happened to the young man? Why was he being carried on a stretcher somewhere?<br><br>The young woman, who was with him, seemed to be used to doing this kind of work. Who is she?<br><br>What will happen to the young man?<br>`,

So, please leave if you don't like any info I wrote above.<br><br>(PS: I dont know how to classify this fanfic but it will contain many slice of life chapters mixed with some actions so I don't know. Well it's up to you guys how you classify this novel whether a slice of life or action etc.<br><br>Warning: Before reading this, I just want to inform you that Kanokari will not be the focus of this and it will be boring mostly for some. I just took the characters so don't expect that the plot will follow KanoKari just because the mc is Kazuya. So please leave and don't review this fic if you don't like it.",
